Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,F209,Mutation affects binding site flexibility and stability.,sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13,literature,F248R,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The evidence clearly indicates that several specific residues in Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) are key determinants of its thermostability by altering the melting temperature (Tm) and unfolding free energy (ΔG°). Below is a detailed discussion of each residue, along with the rationale and supporting literature citations:

1. D204 and E253  
These two residues are perhaps the most intensively studied in relation to thermostability. By engineering mutations that replace D204 and E253 with cysteine (D204C/E253C), a disulfide bond is introduced in the calcium‐binding region. This covalent link significantly rigidifies the local structure and raises the melting temperature—from around 69.8°C to as high as 94.7°C in certain variants. Alternative substitutions, such as D204R/E253R, can also increase Tm by over 14°C; however, they may slightly impair PET-degrading activity. This clearly demonstrates that D204 and E253 are central to achieving higher thermostability through both disulfide bridge formation and salt‐bridge networking in the active enzyme (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 49-52).

2. S121 and D174  
These residues have been effectively targeted in a triple mutant variant (S121P/D174S/D204P). Introduction of a proline at S121 and a serine at D174 (in combination with a proline at D204) leads to an increase in the melting temperature by approximately 9.3°C. Moreover, this engineered variant displayed a remarkable 46-fold enhancement in PET degradation at 70°C. The improvement reflects both enhanced rigidity and reduced local flexibility at the active site surroundings, key factors in thermal stability and catalytic efficiency (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 54-56).

3. G62  
Mutational studies indicate that substitution of glycine at position 62 by alanine (G62A) helps the enzyme maintain its integrity during prolonged thermal treatment—in this case, stability was preserved after 24 hours at 65°C. This suggests that G62, likely positioned near regions important for substrate binding, plays a role in modulating local flexibility which in turn contributes to overall thermostability (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13).

4. I213 (and equivalently N213)  
Two mutations at position 213 have drawn attention. On one hand, the I213S variant is reported to exhibit the highest thermostability amongst several mutants, indicating that even subtle adjustments at this site can enhance the rigidity and folding energy of the protein. On the other hand, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a proline substitution (N213P) at this equivalent position further increases structural rigidity. The conclusion is that residue 213 is a hotspot where even small changes can tune the ΔG° of unfolding by stiffening the local structure (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

5. L90, F209, and F249  
The residue L90 plays a dual role; its mutation is highly sensitive to the nature of the substitution. L90F specifically increased degradation activity (by about 1.5-fold) and is thought to favorably influence the enzyme conformation for stability, while the L90A mutation dramatically reduced degradation activity (by nearly 11.2-fold), suggesting that this position must maintain a delicate equilibrium between catalytic function and structural stability. Similarly, F209 and F249 are part of the hydrophobic patch near the substrate binding cavity. While F209I severely decreases enzymatic activity, F249R impacts binding site flexibility—thus, these residues indirectly affect thermostability by modulating the conformational dynamics of the active site (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, 11-13).

In summary, thermally stabilizing mutations in Thermobifida fusca cutinase predominantly target residues that influence either covalent stabilization (D204 and E253), active-site rigidity (S121, D174, and I213/N213), or the delicate balance between catalytic efficiency and stability (L90, F209, F249). These findings, derived largely from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and computational analyses, provide robust evidence that altering these specific residues can significantly increase the enzyme’s melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding, making it more suitable for industrial applications at elevated temperatures (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, 11-13, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 49-52, 52-54, 54-56)."
Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,S130,Part of the catalytic triad; acts as the nucleophile in ester bond hydrolysis.,"chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9",literature,S169A,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The enzyme in PDB 5ZOA chain A, a Thermobifida fusca cutinase, has been characterized as having a canonical catalytic triad and additional structural features critical for its biochemical function.

The catalytic triad is composed of three residues that work together to perform ester bond hydrolysis. The serine residue—in this case, Ser170—is positioned within a “nucleophile elbow,” a conserved structural motif of the α/β-hydrolase fold. This serine acts as the nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate’s ester bond. Its essential role is supported by active‐site inhibition studies using PMSF, which irreversibly modifies the serine, and by mutagenesis experiments that show substitution of Ser170 with alanine completely abolishes enzymatic activity (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

His248 constitutes the second member of the triad and functions as a general base. During catalysis, His248 is responsible for abstracting a proton from the nucleophilic serine, thereby facilitating its attack on the substrate. Structural homology modeling and biochemical assays have reinforced the critical role of His248 in this proton transfer process (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

The third residue in the triad is an aspartate, which in this enzyme is Asp216. This residue positions and stabilizes His248, ensuring its proper orientation and charge-relay function during the catalytic cycle. The importance of Asp216 is validated by its conservation in related α/β-hydrolases and further supported by both mutagenesis and inhibitor studies (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

Beyond the catalytic triad, the structure features an oxyanion hole that stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate formed during hydrolysis. The oxyanion hole in this enzyme is predicted to be formed by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100. These residues provide critical hydrogen bonds that stabilize the negative charge during the formation of the reaction intermediate, a feature typical of serine hydrolases (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8).

In addition to these core catalytic residues, a key disulfide bond has been identified between Cys241 and Cys259. While not directly involved in the chemical steps of catalysis, this disulfide linkage is essential for maintaining the proper folding and thermostability of the enzyme. Stability assays and kinetic studies have demonstrated that disruption of this disulfide bond leads to reduced catalytic efficiency, underscoring its indirect but vital role in biochemical function (chen2019contributionofdisulfide pages 17-23).

There is also evidence from structure-guided engineering studies that residues surrounding the active site can modulate substrate binding and turnover. For example, surface residues such as Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213 have been implicated in substrate positioning and binding. Mutagenesis of Leu90 and Ile213 has been shown to influence the catalytic rate—altering these residues can either enhance or impair activity, particularly on larger polymeric substrates like PET. These findings suggest that while Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213 are not directly involved in the chemical catalysis, they are essential for optimal substrate interaction and overall catalytic performance (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In summary, the essential residues in T. fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) for catalytic and biochemical function include the catalytic triad—Ser170, His248, and Asp216—supported by the oxyanion hole residues Met171 and Tyr100, and the structural disulfide bond formed by Cys241 and Cys259. Additionally, substrate binding is fine-tuned by residues such as Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213.

Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,S130,"Primary nucleophile in the catalytic triad, essential for ester bond cleavage.",cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The Thermobifida fusca cutinase in PDB 5ZOA chain A has been shown to mediate substrate binding and specificity through a combination of catalytic, stabilizing, and structural residues. The data indicate that three main sets of residues collectively fulfill these roles.

First, the catalytic triad is central to enzyme activity. In this enzyme, Ser170 is situated in a conserved nucleophilic “G‑H‑S‑M‑G” motif that forms the nucleophilic elbow essential for ester bond cleavage. Although His248 and Asp216 complete the triad to orchestrate proton transfers and stabilization during catalysis, Ser170 is the primary actor in nucleophilic attack. This residue is positioned such that it is in close proximity to the scissile bond in substrate docking studies, facilitating catalysis (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50).

Second, substrate binding and transition state stabilization are largely mediated by the oxyanion hole residues. Here, Met171 and Tyr100 have been identified as key contributors. These residues form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate’s ester bond, thereby stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate that forms during nucleophilic attack. The docking data show that the substrate consistently forms hydrogen bonds with these residues, ensuring that the reactive bond is properly oriented relative to Ser170. This precise interaction underlies both effective ligand binding and substrate specificity (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

Third, structural determinants modulate accessibility and the accommodation of substrates within the active site. Protein engineering studies have revealed that residues such as Leu90 and Ile213, which are located near the substrate binding pocket, influence the conformation and hydrophobic character of the binding groove. Specifically, replacing these bulky residues with smaller ones (e.g., Leu90Ala and Ile213Ala) has been shown to increase enzyme activity by reducing steric hindrance and enhancing substrate access. This effect not only confirms their role in shaping the binding site but also underscores the importance of the steric and hydrophobic environment for substrate specificity and turnover (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In docking simulations, the oligo-polyester mimic substrates were shown to partially insert into an exposed hydrophobic groove of the enzyme. While one part of the ligand interacts directly with the active site (through hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion hole residues), the remaining portion is solvent-exposed. This architecture ensures that substrates with bulky aliphatic or aromatic regions are properly accommodated without disrupting the catalytic arrangement. Thus, the combined action of the catalytic triad (particularly Ser170), the oxyanion hole (Met171 and Tyr100), and the additional structural residues (Leu90 and Ile213) provides a finely tuned balance that confers both binding affinity and specificity to the enzyme (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

In summary, Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) uses Ser170 for nucleophilic catalysis, while Met171 and Tyr100 stabilize the reaction intermediate via the oxyanion hole. Residues such as Leu90 and Ile213 contribute to the architecture of the binding groove by modulating its steric and hydrophobic properties, thereby influencing substrate accessibility and overall catalytic efficiency. These conclusions are supported by structural, mutagenesis, and docking studies reported in the literature (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11)."

Third, structural determinants modulate accessibility and the accommodation of substrates within the active site. Protein engineering studies have revealed that residues such as Leu90 and Ile213, which are located near the substrate binding pocket, influence the conformation and hydrophobic character of the binding groove. Specifically, replacing these bulky residues with smaller ones (e.g., Leu90Ala and Ile213Ala) has been shown to increase enzyme activity by reducing steric hindrance and enhancing substrate access. This effect not only confirms their role in shaping the binding site but also underscores the importance of the steric and hydrophobic environment for substrate specificity and turnover (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In docking simulations, the oligo-polyester mimic substrates were shown to partially insert into an exposed hydrophobic groove of the enzyme. While one part of the ligand interacts directly with the active site (through hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion hole residues), the remaining portion is solvent-exposed. This architecture ensures that substrates with bulky aliphatic or aromatic regions are properly accommodated without disrupting the catalytic arrangement. Thus, the combined action of the catalytic triad (particularly Ser170), the oxyanion hole (Met171 and Tyr100), and the additional structural residues (Leu90 and Ile213) provides a finely tuned balance that confers both binding affinity and specificity to the enzyme (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

In summary, Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) uses Ser170 for nucleophilic catalysis, while Met171 and Tyr100 stabilize the reaction intermediate via the oxyanion hole.

Equally important to catalysis is the formation of the oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the tetrahedral transition state intermediate during substrate hydrolysis. In this enzyme, the oxyanion hole is constituted by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100.

In addition to the active site residues, structural stability is enhanced by a putative disulfide bond formed by Cys281 and Cys299.

Although some studies report a slight variation in the numbering (e.g., Asp218 in other homologues), the residue occupying this position is conserved and critical for function (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 12-14).

Equally important to catalysis is the formation of the oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the tetrahedral transition state intermediate during substrate hydrolysis. In this enzyme, the oxyanion hole is constituted by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100. Met171 contributes to shaping the oxyanion hole through its positioning immediately after the nucleophilic serine, while Tyr100 is implicated in hydrogen-bonding to stabilize the negatively charged oxygen in the transition state. These residues are not only conserved but have been validated by both structural and mutagenesis studies as essential for lowering the activation energy of the reaction (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 12-14).

In addition to the active site residues, structural stability is enhanced by a putative disulfide bond formed by Cys281 and Cys299. Disulfide bonds are well known for their role in stabilizing protein folds, particularly in enzymes that need to maintain activity under thermal stress. The conservation of these cysteine residues across homologues suggests that this disulfide linkage is an evolutionarily maintained feature, likely contributing to the thermostability observed in Thermobifida fusca cutinases (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 3-7).

While the catalytic triad, oxyanion hole, and disulfide-bond forming residues are directly highlighted, it is worth noting that additional residues, such as certain tryptophans described in related studies (e.g., Trp105, Trp195, Trp201, and Trp265 in homologues), have roles in maintaining tertiary packing and structural integrity. These tryptophan residues, predominantly buried in hydrophobic pockets, contribute to intrinsic fluorescence properties and overall enzyme stability; however, for PDB 5ZOA chain A the primary functional and stability conservation centers on the aforementioned catalytic and disulfide-bond residues (hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 3-7).

Two different sets of residues emerge as key determinants of thermostability: those involved in salt‐bridge formation near the N‐terminal region and those that contribute to the hydrophobic core packing and dimer stabilization.

One experimental series focused on the N‐terminal segment of EST2. In studies by Foglia and colleagues, deletion of the first 35 N‐terminal residues (which include Ser35 and Tyr22) produced a variant (EST2-36del) with decreased conformational stability and a lower melting temperature compared to the full‐length protein. The disruption of this segment likely perturbs the overall domain coupling that is essential for resisting thermal denaturation (foglia2007roleofthe pages 1-6). Equally significant is Lys102, a residue that forms a strong interdomain salt bridge with Glu43 in a loop linking helix α2 to strand β1. The K102Q mutation, which abolishes this salt bridge, results in lower thermostability as evidenced by shifts in melting temperature and altered unfolding enthalpy. These experiments indicate that the salt bridge between Lys102 and Glu43 plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the core structure; replacing Lys102 disrupts this electrostatic interaction and undermines the energy barrier (ΔG° of unfolding) necessary for thermal resilience (foglia2007roleofthe pages 24-36).

In addition to these salt-bridge interactions, key hydrophobic residues that stabilize the protein’s quaternary structure have been identified from mutational studies in hyperthermophilic homologs such as EstE1. Byun and colleagues demonstrated that in EstE1—structurally similar to EST2—residues Val274 and Phe276 located at the dimer interface are crucial for dimerization and for maintaining a high apparent melting temperature. Although these studies were performed on EstE1, the strong structural similarities with EST2 suggest that analogous hydrophobic contacts are important for EST2 as well (byun2007crystalstructureof pages 6-7, byun2007crystalstructureof pages 7-8). Moreover, work by Rhee et al. on EstE1 highlighted that mutations of residues involved in tight hydrophobic packing (e.g., Ala75 in EstE1, which is likely analogous to a similarly positioned residue in EST2) led to the most dramatic decreases in melting temperature—by decreasing the filling of a critical hydrophobic cavity, they compromise the free energy of unfolding (rhee2006analysisofthe pages 3-4). Similarly, residues that contribute to ion pair networks such as Arg97 and Arg147, when mutated in EstE1, produced lower thermostability.

In summary, the key thermostability determinants identified in Carboxyl-esterase EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) are:

Carboxyl-esterase EST2,1EVQ,A,M209,Part of a region controlling substrate selectivity; M211S mutation alters substrate usage.,soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122,literature,M210S,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,"The structural studies on EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) show that its ligand binding and substrate specificity are dictated by both the canonical catalytic machinery and additional residues lining the substrate‐binding pocket. The catalytic triad—which is critical for all esterase activity—is composed of Ser130, Glu245, and His274. In EST2, Ser130 serves as the nucleophile that initiates the attack on the ester bond and is positioned on the “nucleophilic elbow” within the conserved V-GDS(A/V)GGN motif, while His274 functions as a general base to activate Ser130 for nucleophilic attack; Glu245, although unusual compared to the more common aspartate, completes the triad and participates in proton transfer during catalysis (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

In addition to the triad, the oxyanion hole—typically characterized by a conserved HGGG motif—plays an essential role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state, thereby facilitating catalysis though no individual residue number is explicitly provided for EST2 in the excerpt (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117). The presence of this motif is a hallmark of the α/β hydrolase fold and is conserved among hormone-sensitive lipases, including EST2.

Residues lining the substrate-binding channel further fine-tune ligand specificity. Evidence from site-directed mutagenesis in homologous enzymes indicates that W87, although not directly located in the binding pocket, influences substrate affinity since mutation from tryptophan to phenylalanine (W87F) reduces affinity while leaving substrate range largely unaltered. This suggests that the bulk or electronic properties of W87 have an indirect role in optimal substrate orientation (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Similarly, residue V158 has been shown to be critical in determining the space within the binding site. Mutation of Val158 to alanine (V158A) increases the substrate spectrum and affinity by enlarging the substrate pocket near the catalytic serine and the adjacent oxyanion hole, thereby permitting the accommodation of bulkier acyl chains (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Another set of residues that appears important in controlling substrate selectivity lies near positions 211–215. Double mutations at M211 and R215 (M211S and R215L) have been found to alter substrate usage in EST2 toward longer acyl chains; in homologous enzymes such as Streptomyces EstA, the residue corresponding to W213 is similarly implicated, with mutations (e.g., W213R) leading to changes in substrate spectrum. This region thus seems to form part of the structural framework that directs substrate orientation and chain-length specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Furthermore, conserved proline residues within recognized sequence motifs also contribute structurally. In EST2, the proline within the Q-L-YP motif (P184) is located inside the enzyme pocket where its inherent rigidity likely maintains the geometry of the binding site and assists in substrate positioning, in contrast to the proline in the YRLAPE motif that lies away from the pocket (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117).

Lastly, the overall architecture of EST2 includes an N-terminal α-helical extension that partially covers the active site, imposing a steric constraint that limits substrate chain length and thereby determines specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 110-113, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

Together, these residues – the catalytic triad (Ser130, Glu245, His274), the oxyanion hole’s HGGG motif, W87, V158, M211, R215 (and its associated region including W213), and the structurally important P184 – form an integrated network that mediate ligand binding and specificity in EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117, soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5)."

The catalytic triad—which is critical for all esterase activity—is composed of Ser130, Glu245, and His274. In EST2, Ser130 serves as the nucleophile that initiates the attack on the ester bond and is positioned on the “nucleophilic elbow” within the conserved V-GDS(A/V)GGN motif, while His274 functions as a general base to activate Ser130 for nucleophilic attack; Glu245, although unusual compared to the more common aspartate, completes the triad and participates in proton transfer during catalysis (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

In addition to the triad, the oxyanion hole—typically characterized by a conserved HGGG motif—plays an essential role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state, thereby facilitating catalysis though no individual residue number is explicitly provided for EST2 in the excerpt (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117). The presence of this motif is a hallmark of the α/β hydrolase fold and is conserved among hormone-sensitive lipases, including EST2.

Residues lining the substrate-binding channel further fine-tune ligand specificity. Evidence from site-directed mutagenesis in homologous enzymes indicates that W87, although not directly located in the binding pocket, influences substrate affinity since mutation from tryptophan to phenylalanine (W87F) reduces affinity while leaving substrate range largely unaltered. This suggests that the bulk or electronic properties of W87 have an indirect role in optimal substrate orientation (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Similarly, residue V158 has been shown to be critical in determining the space within the binding site. Mutation of Val158 to alanine (V158A) increases the substrate spectrum and affinity by enlarging the substrate pocket near the catalytic serine and the adjacent oxyanion hole, thereby permitting the accommodation of bulkier acyl chains (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Another set of residues that appears important in controlling substrate selectivity lies near positions 211–215. Double mutations at M211 and R215 (M211S and R215L) have been found to alter substrate usage in EST2 toward longer acyl chains; in homologous enzymes such as Streptomyces EstA, the residue corresponding to W213 is similarly implicated, with mutations (e.g., W213R) leading to changes in substrate spectrum. This region thus seems to form part of the structural framework that directs substrate orientation and chain-length specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

One of the most critical groups of residues is the catalytic triad, which in EST2 is generally understood to comprise a serine, an aspartate, and a histidine. For example, homology modeling studies on EST2 indicate that these correspond to Ser155, Asp252, and His282, where Ser155 is located within the conserved Gly‐X‐Ser‐X‐Gly “nucleophilic elbow” responsible for generating the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis, Asp252 serves to stabilize the histidine’s protonation state, and His282 acts as the general base that facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the ester substrate (manco1999homologymodelingand pages 1-2).

In parallel, structural studies of homologous enzymes such as AeCXE1 and TtEst2 demonstrate that while precise numbering may vary, the triad’s functional roles are universally conserved, underscoring their importance in catalysis across the α/β‐hydrolase fold family (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, sayer2015thestructureof pages 4-5).

Another group of residues that are highly conserved in EST2 and homologues are those lining the substrate binding pocket, where hydrophobic interactions play a dual role in both substrate stabilization and maintaining the integrity of the active site structure. In EST2, mutagenesis and comparative modeling studies have identified Leu205, Leu206, Met210, and Phe214 as key contributors to this hydrophobic environment; these nonpolar residues align to create a pocket that not only helps orient the incoming ester substrate but also maintains the proper conformation of the enzyme’s active site (liu2021proteinengineeringfor pages 9-13).

Furthermore, the stabilization of the transient oxyanion during the catalytic cycle is typically achieved by a set of backbone amides or specific side chains that form the oxyanion hole. Although the precise amino acid numbers for the oxyanion hole in EST2 are not exhaustively detailed in all studies, evidence from homologues, including AeCXE1, points to conserved glycine and alanine residues performing this function; these residues ensure that the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate is effectively neutralized, thereby facilitating catalysis (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15).

Overall, these conserved residues—the catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282), the substrate binding pocket hydrophobic residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214), and those that likely contribute to oxyanion stabilization—are essential not only for the chemical transformation of substrates but also for the structural integrity of the α/β‐hydrolase fold.

The catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282) ensures the direct chemical reactivity essential for ester hydrolysis, while the hydrophobic pocket residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214) and oxyanion hole components provide a robust structural framework that underpins enzyme stability under varied conditions (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15)."

One of the most critical groups of residues is the catalytic triad, which in EST2 is generally understood to comprise a serine, an aspartate, and a histidine. For example, homology modeling studies on EST2 indicate that these correspond to Ser155, Asp252, and His282, where Ser155 is located within the conserved Gly‐X‐Ser‐X‐Gly “nucleophilic elbow” responsible for generating the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis, Asp252 serves to stabilize the histidine’s protonation state, and His282 acts as the general base that facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the ester substrate (manco1999homologymodelingand pages 1-2).

In parallel, structural studies of homologous enzymes such as AeCXE1 and TtEst2 demonstrate that while precise numbering may vary, the triad’s functional roles are universally conserved, underscoring their importance in catalysis across the α/β‐hydrolase fold family (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, sayer2015thestructureof pages 4-5).

Another group of residues that are highly conserved in EST2 and homologues are those lining the substrate binding pocket, where hydrophobic interactions play a dual role in both substrate stabilization and maintaining the integrity of the active site structure. In EST2, mutagenesis and comparative modeling studies have identified Leu205, Leu206, Met210, and Phe214 as key contributors to this hydrophobic environment; these nonpolar residues align to create a pocket that not only helps orient the incoming ester substrate but also maintains the proper conformation of the enzyme’s active site (liu2021proteinengineeringfor pages 9-13).

Furthermore, the stabilization of the transient oxyanion during the catalytic cycle is typically achieved by a set of backbone amides or specific side chains that form the oxyanion hole. Although the precise amino acid numbers for the oxyanion hole in EST2 are not exhaustively detailed in all studies, evidence from homologues, including AeCXE1, points to conserved glycine and alanine residues performing this function; these residues ensure that the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate is effectively neutralized, thereby facilitating catalysis (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15).

Overall, these conserved residues—the catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282), the substrate binding pocket hydrophobic residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214), and those that likely contribute to oxyanion stabilization—are essential not only for the chemical transformation of substrates but also for the structural integrity of the α/β‐hydrolase fold.

Phytase PhyA ( Aspergillus niger ),3K4Q,A,C2,"C31 forms a disulfide bridge with C40, crucial for structural integrity and thermostability.","mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, vasudevan2019retractedthermostablephytase pages 5-6",literature,,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"The thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA, as represented by PDB entry 3K4Q chain A, is significantly influenced by several clusters of residues whose modification alters the enzyme’s melting temperature (Tm) and free energy of unfolding (ΔG°). Below is a detailed explanation of these key residues and the experimental or computational evidence supporting their roles:

1. Residues in the 35–42 Region (e.g., A35 and P42)  
Structural comparison and molecular dynamics studies have revealed that the segment spanning residues 35–42 is thermally sensitive. In one study, replacing the native ANESVISP sequence with the corresponding sequence EDELSVSS from a thermostable homolog resulted in improved thermostability. In particular, the substitution A35E introduces a negative charge that can augment hydrogen bonding, while the conversion of proline at position 42 to serine (P42S) increases local flexibility and potential for hydrogen bond formation. Moreover, complementary work identifies this same region—including Glu35 and Ser42—as forming stabilizing intra-protein interactions that directly correlate with enhanced thermostability (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3).

2. Disulfide Bridge Residues (C31 and C40)  
Cysteine residues C31 and C40, which form one of the five conserved disulfide bridges in PhyA, are fundamental for maintaining the enzyme’s three-dimensional structure. Experimental mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that modifications disrupting this disulfide bridge lead to altered optimal temperature profiles and improved residual activity after heat treatment. This indicates that while the disulfide bond contributes to structural integrity, its elimination or alteration can modulate the stability landscape, possibly by allowing structural rearrangements that favor heat tolerance (mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, vasudevan2019retractedthermostablephytase pages 5-6).

3. Residue I44  
Site-directed mutagenesis of residue I44, converting isoleucine to glutamic acid (I44E), creates a new salt bridge between the introduced glutamate and a neighboring arginine. This new electrostatic interaction stabilizes the local structure, thereby enhancing thermostability without compromising catalytic efficiency. The improvement in catalytic efficiency observed in the mutated PhyA underscores the dual benefit of this modification (liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, pages 13-15).

4. Residues A58 and P65  
Additional substitutions analogous to those identified in homologous thermostable enzymes include A58E and P65S. The A58E mutation introduces a charged residue that can participate in salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, while the P65S mutation replaces a rigid proline with a more flexible serine, facilitating the formation of stabilizing interactions. These mutations have been reported to increase the melting temperature by approximately 7 °C, signifying their substantial impact on protein rigidity and resistance to unfolding (noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, shivange2017recentadvancesin pages 16-19).

5. Residues in the 163–168 Region (e.g., Q168/Arg168)  
Within the second hotspot, residue Q168 is converted to arginine (Q168R) in the thermostable mutants. The introduction of a positively charged arginine fosters new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the enzyme’s tertiary structure under heat stress. This region’s role is further supported by structural analyses that demonstrate significant backbone shifts and interaction differences between less and more thermostable variants (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 3-4).

6. Residues in the 248–254 Region (e.g., T248 and T252)  
Lastly, modifications in the region encompassing residues 248–254 have also been shown to influence thermostability. The mutation T248R (and similarly, T252R as identified independently) replaces a threonine with an arginine, thereby increasing the capacity to form additional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Such substitutions help rigidify the structure and raise the unfolding energy barrier, resulting in enhanced thermal tolerance (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13).

In summary, the combined evidence supports that mutations at residues A35, P42, C31, C40, I44, A58, P65, Q168 (or Arg168), T248 (and T252) can modulate the thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA. These changes primarily work by reinforcing hydrogen bond networks, establishing new salt bridges, and in some cases, by modifying disulfide bridge connectivity, thereby affecting both the melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7)."

This new electrostatic interaction stabilizes the local structure, thereby enhancing thermostability without compromising catalytic efficiency. The improvement in catalytic efficiency observed in the mutated PhyA underscores the dual benefit of this modification (liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, pages 13-15).

4. Residues A58 and P65  
Additional substitutions analogous to those identified in homologous thermostable enzymes include A58E and P65S. The A58E mutation introduces a charged residue that can participate in salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, while the P65S mutation replaces a rigid proline with a more flexible serine, facilitating the formation of stabilizing interactions. These mutations have been reported to increase the melting temperature by approximately 7 °C, signifying their substantial impact on protein rigidity and resistance to unfolding (noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, shivange2017recentadvancesin pages 16-19).

5. Residues in the 163–168 Region (e.g., Q168/Arg168)  
Within the second hotspot, residue Q168 is converted to arginine (Q168R) in the thermostable mutants. The introduction of a positively charged arginine fosters new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the enzyme’s tertiary structure under heat stress. This region’s role is further supported by structural analyses that demonstrate significant backbone shifts and interaction differences between less and more thermostable variants (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 3-4).

6. Residues in the 248–254 Region (e.g., T248 and T252)  
Lastly, modifications in the region encompassing residues 248–254 have also been shown to influence thermostability. The mutation T248R (and similarly, T252R as identified independently) replaces a threonine with an arginine, thereby increasing the capacity to form additional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Such substitutions help rigidify the structure and raise the unfolding energy barrier, resulting in enhanced thermal tolerance (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13).

In summary, the combined evidence supports that mutations at residues A35, P42, C31, C40, I44, A58, P65, Q168 (or Arg168), T248 (and T252) can modulate the thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA. These changes primarily work by reinforcing hydrogen bond networks, establishing new salt bridges, and in some cases, by modifying disulfide bridge connectivity, thereby affecting both the melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7)."

Arg58, His59, and Arg62 lie within the hallmark motif. Arg58 and Arg62 are positively charged and play critical roles in engaging with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the substrate. Their function is twofold: they help to position the substrate within the active site by forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and they contribute to the stabilization of the transition state during catalysis (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 1-2, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13). His59, meanwhile, has been identified as the nucleophile that forms a phosphohistidine intermediate—a key step in the catalytic mechanism of histidine acid phosphatases (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13). This residue is critical both for its chemical reactivity and for maintaining the precise geometry of the active site.

Arg142 is also conserved and contributes to the electrostatic network that stabilizes the binding of the substrate, enhancing both specificity and catalytic efficiency. Its role, along with Arg58 and Arg62, underpins the essential salt bridge interactions that fortify the enzyme’s structural framework (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 1-2, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13).

His338 is another essential residue that has been implicated in ligand (and by extension, substrate) binding. Structural data indicate that His338 interacts with groups on the substrate that mimic its natural binding state, thereby contributing to both activity and the overall integrity of the active site (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, li2014structurefunctionstudiesof pages 60-65).

Finally, Asp339, located adjacent to His338, plays a pivotal role in the catalytic process by acting as a proton donor.

Its dual role in catalysis and in maintaining the active site structure underscores its importance (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13).

Beyond the immediate active site, other residues and salt bridge-forming pairs contribute to the structural stability of PhyA. For instance, salt bridges such as Asp335–Arg136 have been identified as crucial for thermal stability. These interactions help to anchor critical secondary structure elements (for example, beta-sheets and loops) that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the enzyme under thermal stress conditions (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 10-11, oakley2010thestructureof pages 3-4).

Additional salt bridges—such as Glu125–Arg163, Asp299–Arg136, Asp266–Arg219, and Asp339–Lys278—exhibit temperature-dependent variations, suggesting that they contribute to the fine-tuned balance between flexibility and rigidity in PhyA. This balance is essential not only for catalytic function but also for the enzyme’s overall structural endurance in varying thermal environments (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 10-11).

In summary, the residues Arg58, His59, Arg62, Arg142, His338, and Asp339 are highly conserved across phytase homologues and are integral to the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism and structural stability.

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H116,Acts as the initial proton acceptor in the proton transfer pathway.,blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"In T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A), several groups of conserved residues have been identified as essential for catalysis and biochemical regulation. In particular, three distinct sets of functionally critical residues can be delineated: those involved in proton transfer, those that directly coordinate the copper ions in the catalytic centers, and those forming a unique β‐hairpin regulatory motif.

First, a proton transfer network has been characterized that is unique to bacterial laccases compared to their fungal counterparts. In this system, His139 acts as the initial proton acceptor from the solvent. The proton is then passed via Asp452 to Glu451, which delivers the proton to the trinuclear copper center (TNC) through a Grotthuss mechanism. This relay mechanism is supported by multiple crystallographic structures of Tth-MCO, and sequence conservation among bacterial laccases suggests that these residues are critical not only for catalysis but also for the relatively lower overall enzymatic activity when compared to fungal laccases (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).

Second, as expected for multicopper oxidases, the catalytic function depends on proper coordination of copper ions at distinct sites. Although exact numbering for all copper-coordinating residues in 6Q29 chain A is not fully delineated across the provided excerpts, standard evidence from related studies consistently demonstrates that T1 copper is coordinated by two histidine residues and one cysteine (with a methionine sometimes acting as a fourth ligand). In this context, spectroscopic and inhibition data observed in studies of T. thermophilus laccases indicate that conserved histidine and cysteine residues are indispensable for binding copper and thus for electron transfer from the substrate to the TNC (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6). Additional evidence from related work involving T1 copper coordination points to His189 and His303 as key ligands that maintain the proper redox geometry required for catalytic activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Third, a distinct β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper site plays a regulatory role by modulating substrate access. This segment is structurally dynamic and functions as a pH‐dependent switch for enzymatic activity. Within this motif several methionine and histidine residues have been implicated in coordinating ancillary metal ions (e.g., Ag⁺ and Hg⁺) that are thought to regulate the catalytic cycle indirectly. Structural and molecular dynamics studies have identified residues such as Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 as essential for this regulation. These residues not only contribute to metal ion binding but also influence the conformational dynamics of the β‐hairpin, thereby controlling the exposure of the T1 copper site to substrates (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10). The coordinated motion of this motif correlates with shifts in enzyme activity under different pH conditions, making these residues critical for enzyme regulation.

In summary, the essential residues in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:
• His139, Asp452, and Glu451 – forming a proton relay pathway to the trinuclear copper center (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).
• Conserved T1 copper ligands such as His189 and His303 (likely along with a cysteine and sometimes a methionine) that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion, facilitating electron transfer (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).
• β‐hairpin motif residues – notably Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 – which modulate substrate access and regulate activity through pH‐dependent conformational changes (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In particular, three distinct sets of functionally critical residues can be delineated: those involved in proton transfer, those that directly coordinate the copper ions in the catalytic centers, and those forming a unique β‐hairpin regulatory motif.

First, a proton transfer network has been characterized that is unique to bacterial laccases compared to their fungal counterparts. In this system, His139 acts as the initial proton acceptor from the solvent. The proton is then passed via Asp452 to Glu451, which delivers the proton to the trinuclear copper center (TNC) through a Grotthuss mechanism. This relay mechanism is supported by multiple crystallographic structures of Tth-MCO, and sequence conservation among bacterial laccases suggests that these residues are critical not only for catalysis but also for the relatively lower overall enzymatic activity when compared to fungal laccases (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).

Second, as expected for multicopper oxidases, the catalytic function depends on proper coordination of copper ions at distinct sites. Although exact numbering for all copper-coordinating residues in 6Q29 chain A is not fully delineated across the provided excerpts, standard evidence from related studies consistently demonstrates that T1 copper is coordinated by two histidine residues and one cysteine (with a methionine sometimes acting as a fourth ligand). In this context, spectroscopic and inhibition data observed in studies of T. thermophilus laccases indicate that conserved histidine and cysteine residues are indispensable for binding copper and thus for electron transfer from the substrate to the TNC (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6). Additional evidence from related work involving T1 copper coordination points to His189 and His303 as key ligands that maintain the proper redox geometry required for catalytic activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Third, a distinct β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper site plays a regulatory role by modulating substrate access. This segment is structurally dynamic and functions as a pH‐dependent switch for enzymatic activity. Within this motif several methionine and histidine residues have been implicated in coordinating ancillary metal ions (e.g., Ag⁺ and Hg⁺) that are thought to regulate the catalytic cycle indirectly. Structural and molecular dynamics studies have identified residues such as Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 as essential for this regulation. These residues not only contribute to metal ion binding but also influence the conformational dynamics of the β‐hairpin, thereby controlling the exposure of the T1 copper site to substrates (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H166,Key histidine modulating β-hairpin conformation via pH-dependent protonation.,mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available structural and simulation data indicate that the pH‐dependent allosteric regulation and conformational switching observed in the T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) are mediated predominantly by residues within a unique, methionine‐rich β‐hairpin that is located close to the T1 copper site. Multiple independent studies provide convergent evidence for the involvement of both polar/charged and hydrophobic (methionine) residues in modulating the mobility of this region in response to environmental conditions.

One set of residues comprises key histidines residing at the base of the β‐hairpin. In particular, His189 and His303 have been implicated as critical actors. Their protonation states are sensitive to pH, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that changes in their electrostatic environment correlate with the conformational transitions of the β‐hairpin (switching between open and closed states). Such pH‐dependent variations are proposed to alter the relative positioning of the β‐hairpin with respect to the T1 copper site, thereby controlling substrate access and enzyme activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

A second group of residues involves the methionine side chains that populate the β‐hairpin. Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;

• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;
• Clusters of methionine residues (notably M192, M195, M292, M296, M301, M305, M354, M355, and M391) that form transient metal‐binding sites and influence structural mobility;
• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Each of these residues, by contributing to either direct interactions or modulating the local electrostatic landscape, plays a role in the allosteric regulation of laccase activity via conformational switching (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10, blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90)."

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,D367,Charged residue modulating electrostatic environment affecting β-hairpin conformation.,mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available structural and simulation data indicate that the pH‐dependent allosteric regulation and conformational switching observed in the T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) are mediated predominantly by residues within a unique, methionine‐rich β‐hairpin that is located close to the T1 copper site. Multiple independent studies provide convergent evidence for the involvement of both polar/charged and hydrophobic (methionine) residues in modulating the mobility of this region in response to environmental conditions.

One set of residues comprises key histidines residing at the base of the β‐hairpin. In particular, His189 and His303 have been implicated as critical actors. Their protonation states are sensitive to pH, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that changes in their electrostatic environment correlate with the conformational transitions of the β‐hairpin (switching between open and closed states). Such pH‐dependent variations are proposed to alter the relative positioning of the β‐hairpin with respect to the T1 copper site, thereby controlling substrate access and enzyme activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

A second group of residues involves the methionine side chains that populate the β‐hairpin. Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;
• Clusters of methionine residues (notably M192, M195, M292, M296, M301, M305, M354, M355, and M391) that form transient metal‐binding sites and influence structural mobility;
• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Each of these residues, by contributing to either direct interactions or modulating the local electrostatic landscape, plays a role in the allosteric regulation of laccase activity via conformational switching (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10, blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90)."

The T1Cu site is coordinated by His393, His450, and Cys445, which are essential for electron transfer during substrate oxidation. These residues not only stabilize the T1Cu center but also create the redox environment required for catalysis, thereby directly influencing substrate interaction and specificity (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 22-25).

In addition to the primary copper ligands, the β‐hairpin region—which acts as a regulatory switch—plays a major role in modulating substrate access to the T1Cu site. In the open conformation, as observed in the 6Q29 structure, the β‐hairpin enlarges the substrate‐binding cavity, thereby facilitating substrate access. Within this β‐hairpin, residues His189 and His303 are particularly significant. Their protonation states change with pH and directly affect the conformation of the β‐hairpin, which in turn regulates the size of the cavity available for substrate binding (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6).

There is also evidence supporting the role of conserved methionine residues in the β‐hairpin region. For instance, a cluster of methionines—such as M298, M301, and M305—is arranged in a manner that suggests they may form auxiliary metal‐binding sites. Although these methionine residues are not the primary ligands for the catalytic copper ions, they may contribute indirectly to substrate specificity by stabilizing the overall conformation of the substrate‐binding pocket through metal coordination and structural anchoring. This dynamic metal binding is hypothesized to fine‐tune the electrostatic and steric environment around the active site (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

The pH‐dependent movement of the β‐hairpin is critical because it functions as a molecular gate that alternates between open and closed states. At acidic pH, the open conformation increases the solvent-accessible surface area near the T1Cu site and enhances substrate binding, as indicated by the increased cavity area measured in the open state (approximately 295.7 Å²). This gating mechanism is controlled by the interplay of protonation states of histidine residues—including those mentioned above—and the overall flexibility of the β‐hairpin, thereby directly impacting the enzyme’s substrate specificity and turnover (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6).

Thus, the integrated mechanism of ligand recognition and specificity in PDB 6Q29 chain A involves (1) direct coordination of the T1Cu by His393, His450, and Cys445, which is essential for substrate oxidation and electron transfer; and (2) a dynamic β‐hairpin region, where residues His189 and His303 regulate access to the T1Cu site via pH-dependent conformational changes, supported in part by a cluster of methionine residues that may modulate the local metal environment and structural integrity of the substrate-binding pocket (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 22-25, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6)."
Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H373,Primary copper ligand coordinating the T1 copper ion.,Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The laccase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 6Q29 chain A) exhibits several highly conserved residues among its homologues that are integral to both its catalytic function and structural stability.

One set of key residues is found within the type‐1 (T1) copper site. Experimental and mutational studies identify His397, Cys450, and His455 as the primary copper ligands that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion. In addition, the axial ligand—Met460—plays a crucial role in tuning the redox potential and electron transfer efficiency. Mutation studies have shown that substituting the axial ligand can markedly alter enzymatic performance, underscoring its functional importance (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Sequence alignment and mutagenesis work also highlight conserved copper‐binding residues near the T1 site. For example, His444, His450, and Met455 (noting slight numbering differences common in homologues) are conserved across bacterial and fungal laccases. Although residue Arg453 in the wild‐type enzyme is not strictly conserved in all homologues, its mutation to threonine (R453T) improved catalytic activity and pH stability without disrupting copper incorporation or overall protein folding. This finding indicates that, while the arginine’s conservation is unique, the surrounding copper‐binding microenvironment constituted by His444, His450, and Met455 is a hallmark of T1 site structural integrity (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).

Beyond the immediate T1 copper ligands, second-sphere residues also contribute to the enzyme’s performance by modulating hydrogen-bond networks and the spatial arrangement of the trinuclear copper cluster. Conserved acidic residues such as Asp106 and Glu456 have been shown to affect the copper-copper distances and, as a result, the kinetics and stability of the enzyme. Their role in establishing finely tuned electrostatic interactions adjacent to the active sites emphasizes their importance not only for catalytic efficiency but also for maintaining structural stability under thermal stress (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

A further structural element is the β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper center. In Thermus thermophilus laccase, this region contains a cluster of conserved methionine residues (notably M292, M295, M298, M301, and M305) along with the conserved His303. The β‐hairpin functions as a pH-dependent switch, regulating substrate access and overall activity by undergoing conformational changes linked to protonation states. Additional conserved acidic residues in and around this motif, such as Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442, contribute to the electrostatic landscape that modulates β‐hairpin dynamics and, ultimately, substrate binding and electron transfer events (Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10).

Finally, broader analyses of thermostability in laccases from T. thermophilus indicate that other conserved residues—often involved in disulfide bonding (cysteines), hydrogen bonding (threonines), and hydrophobic interactions (phenylalanines)—support the overall structural framework of the enzyme. These residues help maintain the integrity of the cupredoxin-like β-barrel domains and ensure that the active site remains properly configured under extreme conditions (Tiwari2024precisionthermostabilitypredictions pages 11-13, Dwivedi2011structure–functionrelationshipamong pages 5-8).

In summary, the most critical conserved residues found in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:

• T1 copper site ligands: His397, Cys450, His455, and axial ligand Met460 (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,E244,Acidic residue modulating β-hairpin dynamics and substrate binding.,Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"The laccase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 6Q29 chain A) exhibits several highly conserved residues among its homologues that are integral to both its catalytic function and structural stability.

One set of key residues is found within the type‐1 (T1) copper site. Experimental and mutational studies identify His397, Cys450, and His455 as the primary copper ligands that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion. In addition, the axial ligand—Met460—plays a crucial role in tuning the redox potential and electron transfer efficiency. Mutation studies have shown that substituting the axial ligand can markedly alter enzymatic performance, underscoring its functional importance (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Sequence alignment and mutagenesis work also highlight conserved copper‐binding residues near the T1 site. For example, His444, His450, and Met455 (noting slight numbering differences common in homologues) are conserved across bacterial and fungal laccases. Although residue Arg453 in the wild‐type enzyme is not strictly conserved in all homologues, its mutation to threonine (R453T) improved catalytic activity and pH stability without disrupting copper incorporation or overall protein folding. This finding indicates that, while the arginine’s conservation is unique, the surrounding copper‐binding microenvironment constituted by His444, His450, and Met455 is a hallmark of T1 site structural integrity (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).

Beyond the immediate T1 copper ligands, second-sphere residues also contribute to the enzyme’s performance by modulating hydrogen-bond networks and the spatial arrangement of the trinuclear copper cluster. Conserved acidic residues such as Asp106 and Glu456 have been shown to affect the copper-copper distances and, as a result, the kinetics and stability of the enzyme. Their role in establishing finely tuned electrostatic interactions adjacent to the active sites emphasizes their importance not only for catalytic efficiency but also for maintaining structural stability under thermal stress (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

A further structural element is the β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper center. In Thermus thermophilus laccase, this region contains a cluster of conserved methionine residues (notably M292, M295, M298, M301, and M305) along with the conserved His303. The β‐hairpin functions as a pH-dependent switch, regulating substrate access and overall activity by undergoing conformational changes linked to protonation states. Additional conserved acidic residues in and around this motif, such as Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442, contribute to the electrostatic landscape that modulates β‐hairpin dynamics and, ultimately, substrate binding and electron transfer events (Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10).

Finally, broader analyses of thermostability in laccases from T. thermophilus indicate that other conserved residues—often involved in disulfide bonding (cysteines), hydrogen bonding (threonines), and hydrophobic interactions (phenylalanines)—support the overall structural framework of the enzyme. These residues help maintain the integrity of the cupredoxin-like β-barrel domains and ensure that the active site remains properly configured under extreme conditions (Tiwari2024precisionthermostabilitypredictions pages 11-13, Dwivedi2011structure–functionrelationshipamong pages 5-8).

In summary, the most critical conserved residues found in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:

• T1 copper site ligands: His397, Cys450, His455, and axial ligand Met460 (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).  
• Adjacent conserved residues in the T1 environment: His444, His450, Met455 along with the modulatory role of Arg453 (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).  
• Second-sphere acidic residues: Asp106 and Glu456, which fine-tune the active site geometry and hydrogen bonding (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,W263,Critical for thermostability and active site loop rigidity; mutations decrease Tm and enzyme function.,"Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 132-133, suzumoto2020structuralandfunctional pages 14-16",literature,W262A;W262F;W262Y,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,"The evidence indicates that a few key residues in SsoPox lactonase (PDB 3UF9 chain A) have a measurable impact on thermostability, primarily by altering the melting temperature (Tm) or the unfolding free energy (ΔG°).

One of the most critical residues is tryptophan at position 263 (W263). Multiple mutagenesis studies demonstrated that any substitution at this position consistently decreases the overall protein thermostability. W263 is located on loop 8, where it plays a dual role in forming part of the active site and contributing to the dimer interface. Mutations at this site lead to increased loop flexibility, which correlates with a significant drop in Tm and perturbed enzyme function. The evidence shows that the stability of loop 8 hinges on the presence of W263, as substitutions here dramatically shift the balance between rigidity (necessary for high thermostability) and the flexibility required for catalytic promiscuity (Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 132-133, suzumoto2020structuralandfunctional pages 14-16).

In addition to W263, residues at positions 14 and 34 also affect thermostability. SsoPox naturally contains Lys14 (K14) and Tyr34 (Y34), which contrast with the corresponding residues in the closely related SisLac enzyme. Mutagenesis studies that mimic the SsoPox residues in SisLac show that an E14K change (mimicking the SsoPox K14) and a Y34Q change (mimicking the SsoPox Y34) affect the protein’s thermal profile. Independent mutations at these positions in SisLac resulted in decreases in melting temperature of approximately 6°C for E14K and 8°C for Y34Q. Interestingly, a double mutant combining both changes showed partial recuperation of Tm, which is interpreted as evidence of epistatic interactions influencing the stability of the dimer interface. These findings underscore the importance of the specific charge and hydrogen-bonding properties at positions 14 and 34 in maintaining a robust structure at elevated temperatures (Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 84-85, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 12-13).

Structural comparisons and further mutational studies on SsoPox also indicate that the overall network of surface-exposed charged residues contributes substantially to thermostability. Although no single mutation was exclusively highlighted in this context, several charged residues participate in salt bridge networks that stabilize the protein structure. For instance, the formation of a salt bridge between the terminal carboxyl group of Ser314 and the guanidinium group of Arg2, along with the presence of rigidifying prolines (Pro4 and Pro309), contributes to the high Tm observed for SsoPox. Such inter-residue interactions are critical to reduce the overall solvent accessibility and maintain the integrity of the dimer interface, thereby resisting thermal denaturation. These factors are supported by structural analyses that correlate the density of salt bridges with increased thermostability (Mandrich2010hyperthermophilicphosphotriesteraseslactonasesfor pages 7-9).

In summary, the experimental mutagenesis and structural studies point to W263 as a central residue modulating the flexibility of an essential active site loop and directly impacting Tm. In addition, the dimer interface residues K14 and Y34 are vital for achieving optimal thermostability, possibly through their influence on charged interactions and interface organization. Finally, the broader network of salt bridges involving residues like Arg2, Ser314, Pro4, and Pro309 further reinforces the thermostable architecture of SsoPox."

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,H22,Coordinates the α-site metal ion for catalysis.,"elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The enzyme SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) requires several key residues for its catalytic and substrate‐binding functions. These residues can be divided into those that coordinate the binuclear metal center essential for nucleophile activation and those that mediate substrate positioning and active‐site dynamics.

First, the integrity of the binuclear metal center is maintained by six conserved residues. His22 and His24 act as ligands that coordinate the α‐site metal ion, establishing one of the two metal-binding sites necessary for catalysis (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33). Similarly, His170 and His199 participate in binding the β‐site metal ion, ensuring proper geometry and activation of the bridging water molecule. This water, which becomes a hydroxide nucleophile during catalysis, is further stabilized by Asp256, a residue strategically positioned to interact with the bridging hydroxide and polarize the substrate’s carbonyl group (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, pages 7-10). In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10).

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,H22,Coordinates the α-site metal ion for catalysis.,"elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The enzyme SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) requires several key residues for its catalytic and substrate‐binding functions. These residues can be divided into those that coordinate the binuclear metal center essential for nucleophile activation and those that mediate substrate positioning and active‐site dynamics.

First, the integrity of the binuclear metal center is maintained by six conserved residues. His22 and His24 act as ligands that coordinate the α‐site metal ion, establishing one of the two metal-binding sites necessary for catalysis (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33). Similarly, His170 and His199 participate in binding the β‐site metal ion, ensuring proper geometry and activation of the bridging water molecule. This water, which becomes a hydroxide nucleophile during catalysis, is further stabilized by Asp256, a residue strategically positioned to interact with the bridging hydroxide and polarize the substrate’s carbonyl group (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, pages 7-10). In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10).

In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10). Finally, L226, which helps form the hydrophobic channel adjacent to the active site, influences substrate specificity by affecting acyl chain binding without being directly involved in catalysis (langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92).

In summary, the catalytic efficiency and specificity of SsoPox arise from an integrated network of residues: His22, His24, His170, His199, Asp256, and carboxylated Lys137 maintain the metal center needed for hydroxide activation; Tyr97 (with supportive roles for Tyr194) and Arg223 facilitate substrate orientation and stabilization of intermediates; while W263 in loop 8 modulates active site conformation, and Cys258 and L226 contribute to substrate interactions. These conclusions are supported by structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis studies reported in multiple independent sources (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, 5-7, 7-10; hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, 9-9; langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33, 86-92; ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29, 35-38)."

First, the aromatic residue tryptophan at position 263 (W263) stands out as the central mediator of conformational switching. Multiple mutagenesis studies showed that substituting W263 with a variety of amino acids (F, L, M, I, V, T) leads to marked differences in loop 8 conformations, which in turn affect substrate binding and catalytic promiscuity. These substitutions cause altered normalized B-factors in residues 250–285, a change that correlates with significant variations in phosphotriesterase and lactonase activities. The disruptive effect of mutations at W263 is not solely due to chemical changes at the active site, but rather through inducing alternative structural ensembles that control the dynamics of the enzyme’s active site loop. In other words, W263 functions as a critical switch whose altered flexibility is directly responsible for the modulation of substrate specificity and enzyme efficiency (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 3-4, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

A second residue implicated in the regulation of conformational switching is found at position 34. In SsoPox, residue 34 is a glutamine (Q34), which participates in hydrogen bonding across the dimer interface. Structural comparisons between SsoPox and its close homolog SisLac reveal that position 34 plays a pivotal role in intermonomer contacts. In SsoPox, the presence of Q34 ensures a specific dimer orientation that indirectly influences the conformation of the loops near the active site. Perturbations at this site—evidenced by mutagenesis in related proteins—demonstrate a reduction in catalytic efficiency and stability. This indicates that Q34 may act in an allosteric manner by propagating structural changes from the dimer interface to the active site cleft, thus modulating enzymatic function (hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 9-11, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 11-12).

A third candidate residue is located at position 14. In SsoPox, this residue is a lysine (K14) that forms part of an extensive network of salt bridges and electrostatic interactions near the dimer interface. Although its primary role is in maintaining protein rigidity and stability, K14 affects the local conformation of the dimer interface and, by extension, the active site environment. Analyses of the corresponding mutations in homologous lactonases indicate that even subtle changes in these charged residues can alter melting temperature and catalytic performance, suggesting an indirect allosteric contribution. By influencing the strength and pattern of its electrostatic interactions, K14 is well positioned to participate in the conformational switching processes that adjust substrate access or product release (hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 8-9, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 11-12).

In summary, the cumulative evidence supports that W263 directly modulates active site loop flexibility and is essential for the enzyme’s promiscuous activity, while Q34 and K14 serve significant roles in controlling dimer interactions and stability, which in turn affect the overall conformation of the active site. Together, these residues effectively mediate allosteric regulatory mechanisms and conformational switching in SsoPox (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 9-11)."

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,Y97,Key role in hydrogen-bond formation with active site water for substrate positioning.,hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The structural and biochemical data for SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) reveal that three residues stand out as major determinants for ligand and substrate binding as well as specificity: tyrosine 97 (Y97), tryptophan 263 (W263), and arginine 223 (R223).

Y97 is located in the active site near the bi‐metallic center. Its hydroxyl group plays a key role in hydrogen‐bond formation with an active site water molecule coordinated by the more exposed β-metal (commonly cobalt in SsoPox). This hydrogen bond is critical because it helps to position the lactone ring of the substrate optimally for catalysis. The conservation of Y97 among phosphotriesterase‐like lactonases (PLLs) and metallo-β-lactamases further underscores its essential role in ligand recognition and binding specificity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

W263 is positioned at the beginning of loop 8, which forms a hydrophobic channel critical for accommodating the aliphatic acyl chain of lactones. Structural and mutagenesis studies have shown that W263 not only directly interacts with substrate molecules but also plays an important role in modulating the conformational flexibility of loop 8. Mutations at this residue (e.g., to leucine, threonine, or other residues) have been demonstrated to reshape the active site cavity, thereby altering substrate preference and catalytic promiscuity. These findings underscore the pivotal role of W263 in determining which ligands can be bound effectively and in dictating the dynamic properties of the binding groove (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-11).

R223 contributes to the structural definition of the substrate‐binding pocket by interacting electrostatically with the substrate or inhibitor molecules. Although not always directly engaging the substrate in all binding modes, R223 influences the steric environment of the active site. Its side chain is positioned such that it can provide additional interactions—through either direct hydrogen bonding or electrostatic contacts—that help stabilize productive substrate orientations over non-productive ones. The presence of R223 is associated with the enzyme’s relatively small sub‐site size compared to classical phosphotriesterases (PTEs), which is reflected in the high KM values observed for larger phosphotriester substrates (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2016currentandemerging pages 11-13).

Together, these residues illustrate an interdependent network where Y97 anchors substrates via a critical water-mediated hydrogen bond, W263 shapes the active site by dictating loop 8 flexibility and substrate access, and R223 helps fine-tune space and charge complementarity. Their roles are supported by both crystallographic data (e.g., from the structure PDB 3UF9) and complementary kinetic studies that show how mutations at these positions alter enzymatic activity and substrate turnover. This integrated view is key not only for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SsoPox but also for guiding future protein engineering efforts aimed at enhancing its promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, jacquet2016currentandemerging pages 11-13)."

Y97 is located in the active site near the bi‐metallic center. Its hydroxyl group plays a key role in hydrogen‐bond formation with an active site water molecule coordinated by the more exposed β-metal (commonly cobalt in SsoPox). This hydrogen bond is critical because it helps to position the lactone ring of the substrate optimally for catalysis. The conservation of Y97 among phosphotriesterase‐like lactonases (PLLs) and metallo-β-lactamases further underscores its essential role in ligand recognition and binding specificity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

W263 is positioned at the beginning of loop 8, which forms a hydrophobic channel critical for accommodating the aliphatic acyl chain of lactones. Structural and mutagenesis studies have shown that W263 not only directly interacts with substrate molecules but also plays an important role in modulating the conformational flexibility of loop 8. Mutations at this residue (e.g., to leucine, threonine, or other residues) have been demonstrated to reshape the active site cavity, thereby altering substrate preference and catalytic promiscuity. These findings underscore the pivotal role of W263 in determining which ligands can be bound effectively and in dictating the dynamic properties of the binding groove (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-11).

R223 contributes to the structural definition of the substrate‐binding pocket by interacting electrostatically with the substrate or inhibitor molecules. Although not always directly engaging the substrate in all binding modes, R223 influences the steric environment of the active site. Its side chain is positioned such that it can provide additional interactions—through either direct hydrogen bonding or electrostatic contacts—that help stabilize productive substrate orientations over non-productive ones.

Each residue is discussed along with the supporting evidence from the literature excerpts.

One major residue repeatedly highlighted is tryptophan 263 (W263). Located within active site loop 8—a region that modulates both substrate binding and the orientation between enzyme monomers—W263 is conserved across homologues and has been shown to play a key role in regulating loop flexibility. Mutagenesis studies indicate that substitutions at W263 dramatically alter phosphotriesterase activity by reshaping the active site architecture without a total loss of lactonase function. This underscores its dual role in structural integrity (through stabilizing loop 8 dynamics) and catalytic efficiency (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 3-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5).

Tyrosine 97 (Y97) is another residue that is highly conserved among PLL enzymes. Y97 is positioned in the active site where it participates in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that is coordinated by one of the binuclear metal centers. This interaction is critical for proper substrate orientation during lactone hydrolysis. Mutation experiments reinforcing its importance show that altering Y97 affects both substrate binding and catalysis, further linking Y97 to the enzyme’s catalytic function and stability (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8).

Arginine 223 (R223) also emerges as an important residue. In SsoPox, R223 is analogous to a histidine found in related organophosphate hydrolases (specifically His254 in OPH), and studies have indicated that substitutions at this position (or its counterparts) lead to a significant decrease in catalytic activity against paraoxon. This functional link suggests that R223 is critical for the proper formation of the metal-coordinating environment and overall substrate positioning (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13, hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

Leucine 226 (L226) is also consistently mentioned as a conserved residue. It corresponds to His257 in OPH and plays a role in shaping the active site geometry. Changes at this residue are linked to alterations in catalytic efficiency, particularly with respect to the paraoxon substrate, thus indicating its contribution to both catalytic specificity and stability of the active center (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13).

In addition to the aforementioned catalytic residues, valine 27 (V27) has been identified as contributing to enzyme stability and substrate access. Located at the periphery of the active site cavity, substitutions such as V27A have been employed in engineering efforts to increase loop mobility and expand the active site, thereby modulating substrate selectivity while preserving overall structural integrity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Other residues, including leucine 228 (L228) and tyrosine 99 (Y99), appear in mutational studies aimed at enlarging the active site pocket. L228 is part of the loop region adjacent to W263 and contributes to the formation of a proper substrate binding platform, while Y99 is involved in forming the hydrophobic channel that accommodates lactone substrates.

Located within active site loop 8—a region that modulates both substrate binding and the orientation between enzyme monomers—W263 is conserved across homologues and has been shown to play a key role in regulating loop flexibility. Mutagenesis studies indicate that substitutions at W263 dramatically alter phosphotriesterase activity by reshaping the active site architecture without a total loss of lactonase function. This underscores its dual role in structural integrity (through stabilizing loop 8 dynamics) and catalytic efficiency (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 3-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5).

Tyrosine 97 (Y97) is another residue that is highly conserved among PLL enzymes. Y97 is positioned in the active site where it participates in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that is coordinated by one of the binuclear metal centers. This interaction is critical for proper substrate orientation during lactone hydrolysis. Mutation experiments reinforcing its importance show that altering Y97 affects both substrate binding and catalysis, further linking Y97 to the enzyme’s catalytic function and stability (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8).

Arginine 223 (R223) also emerges as an important residue. In SsoPox, R223 is analogous to a histidine found in related organophosphate hydrolases (specifically His254 in OPH), and studies have indicated that substitutions at this position (or its counterparts) lead to a significant decrease in catalytic activity against paraoxon. This functional link suggests that R223 is critical for the proper formation of the metal-coordinating environment and overall substrate positioning (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13, hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

Leucine 226 (L226) is also consistently mentioned as a conserved residue. It corresponds to His257 in OPH and plays a role in shaping the active site geometry. Changes at this residue are linked to alterations in catalytic efficiency, particularly with respect to the paraoxon substrate, thus indicating its contribution to both catalytic specificity and stability of the active center (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13).

In addition to the aforementioned catalytic residues, valine 27 (V27) has been identified as contributing to enzyme stability and substrate access. Located at the periphery of the active site cavity, substitutions such as V27A have been employed in engineering efforts to increase loop mobility and expand the active site, thereby modulating substrate selectivity while preserving overall structural integrity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Other residues, including leucine 228 (L228) and tyrosine 99 (Y99), appear in mutational studies aimed at enlarging the active site pocket. L228 is part of the loop region adjacent to W263 and contributes to the formation of a proper substrate binding platform, while Y99 is involved in forming the hydrophobic channel that accommodates lactone substrates. Their conservation across homologues and deliberate targeting in engineering experiments indicate that these residues are critical for both maintaining structure and dictating substrate specificity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Collectively, the evidence from kinetic analyses, crystallographic structures, and targeted mutagenesis supports that residues W263, Y97, R223, L226, V27, along with L228 and Y99, are highly conserved elements in SsoPox lactonase that govern both its catalytic function and structural stability."

One critical set of residues is Cys47 and Cys202, which form intersubunit disulfide bridges that stabilize the tetrameric assembly of TaCA. These disulfide bonds increase the melting temperature (Tm) and reduce the unfolding free energy (ΔG° of unfolding) by reducing conformational fluctuations, as evidenced by crystallographic and thermal stability analyses (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9).

Mutational studies have identified N140 as an important residue; alteration of this residue (e.g., the N140G mutation) dramatically enhanced thermostability, with the mutant retaining full activity after high‑temperature incubation. This finding underscores that local sequence flexibility around residue 140 is critical for maintaining rigidity at elevated temperatures (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 14-19).

Residue T175 is another site where proline substitution (T175P) has been introduced to rigidify flexible loop regions. Although this mutation confers moderate improvement in thermostability by decreasing local entropy, it must be optimally balanced because modifications in this region can shift the stability profile with temperature (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

In contrast, mutation at residue A242 (e.g., to proline, A242P) resulted in a reduction of stability, indicating that the natural alanine plays an essential role in maintaining an optimal flexible–rigid balance; thus, residue A242 is critical for preserving the native thermodynamic properties (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Furthermore, residues P165 and Q170 have been targeted for engineering de novo disulfide bonds. When these residues are mutated to cysteine (P165C and Q170C), the resulting covalent linkage adds rigidity to the protein structure, leading to an increased melting temperature and enhanced stability by effectively reducing the local unfolding rate (jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Residue C67 has also been implicated in thermostability. Interestingly, the mutation from C67 to glycine (C67G) was found to increase thermostability by alleviating potential steric or binding constraints imposed by the native disulfide bond at this position, highlighting its complex role in both substrate binding and structural rigidity (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Although the specific study on T. ammonificans CA does not list all the surface residues directly, analogous studies on related carbonic anhydrases indicate that strategic mutations to enhance salt-bridge networks can significantly alter thermostability. In particular, mutagenesis studies on mesophilic carbonic anhydrases using mutations such as S44R, S139E, and K168R have demonstrated that the introduction of new salt bridges increases rigidity, reduces the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and consequently elevates melting temperatures. Their role as charged residues in forming a stabilizing network supports a similar mechanism in naturally thermostable enzymes like T. ammonificans CA (bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19).

Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,C45,C67G mutation increased thermostability by alleviating steric constraints.,parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14,literature,C66G,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"The thermostability of the T. ammonificans carbonic anhydrase (CA) in pdb 4C3T chain A is influenced by several key residues that act either by forming strong intersubunit interactions or by modulating local flexibility and rigidity within the enzyme’s structure.

One critical set of residues is Cys47 and Cys202, which form intersubunit disulfide bridges that stabilize the tetrameric assembly of TaCA. These disulfide bonds increase the melting temperature (Tm) and reduce the unfolding free energy (ΔG° of unfolding) by reducing conformational fluctuations, as evidenced by crystallographic and thermal stability analyses (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9).

Mutational studies have identified N140 as an important residue; alteration of this residue (e.g., the N140G mutation) dramatically enhanced thermostability, with the mutant retaining full activity after high‑temperature incubation. This finding underscores that local sequence flexibility around residue 140 is critical for maintaining rigidity at elevated temperatures (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 14-19).

Residue T175 is another site where proline substitution (T175P) has been introduced to rigidify flexible loop regions. Although this mutation confers moderate improvement in thermostability by decreasing local entropy, it must be optimally balanced because modifications in this region can shift the stability profile with temperature (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

In contrast, mutation at residue A242 (e.g., to proline, A242P) resulted in a reduction of stability, indicating that the natural alanine plays an essential role in maintaining an optimal flexible–rigid balance; thus, residue A242 is critical for preserving the native thermodynamic properties (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Furthermore, residues P165 and Q170 have been targeted for engineering de novo disulfide bonds. When these residues are mutated to cysteine (P165C and Q170C), the resulting covalent linkage adds rigidity to the protein structure, leading to an increased melting temperature and enhanced stability by effectively reducing the local unfolding rate (jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Residue C67 has also been implicated in thermostability. Interestingly, the mutation from C67 to glycine (C67G) was found to increase thermostability by alleviating potential steric or binding constraints imposed by the native disulfide bond at this position, highlighting its complex role in both substrate binding and structural rigidity (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Although the specific study on T. ammonificans CA does not list all the surface residues directly, analogous studies on related carbonic anhydrases indicate that strategic mutations to enhance salt-bridge networks can significantly alter thermostability. In particular, mutagenesis studies on mesophilic carbonic anhydrases using mutations such as S44R, S139E, and K168R have demonstrated that the introduction of new salt bridges increases rigidity, reduces the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and consequently elevates melting temperatures. Their role as charged residues in forming a stabilizing network supports a similar mechanism in naturally thermostable enzymes like T. ammonificans CA (bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19).

In summary, in T. ammonificans CA the residues Cys47 and Cys202 are fundamental for structural stability through disulfide bonds, while alterations at N140, T175, A242, P165, Q170, and C67 modulate thermostability by affecting local flexibility, disulfide bridge formation, and overall network rigidity, with supportive evidence coming from multiple computational and experimental studies (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14, jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19)."
Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,H97,Coordinates the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion for CO₂ hydration.,"fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The T. ammonificans α‐carbonic anhydrase structure (PDB 4C3T chain A) relies on a set of key residues for its catalytic and biochemical function. Several studies focusing on thermophilic bacterial α‐CAs consistently show that the enzyme’s activity depends on proper zinc ion coordination, proton transfer, and structural stabilization.

First, the zinc‐binding site is the heart of the catalytic machinery. In the LOGACA enzyme discussed by Fredslund et al., three histidine residues—His117, His119, and His136—coordinate the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion. Their side‐chain imidazole groups form bonds with the zinc ion at distances between 2.06 and 2.28 Å. This precise coordination positions the zinc to polarize a water molecule, thereby generating a zinc‐bound hydroxide that serves as the nucleophile attacking CO₂ during catalysis (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6).

Equally important is the mechanism for proton transfer. In the same study, His92 is identified as the proton shuttle residue. By moving between distinct conformations, His92 facilitates the removal of a proton from the zinc‐bound water molecule, thus regenerating the active site and ensuring continuous catalytic turnover. This role of a proton shuttle is a conserved feature in α‐CAs, also evidenced in other structurally characterized bacterial CAs (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 6-9).

Additionally, Thr202 is described as an important residue due to its proximity to the zinc site. Even though Thr202 in this enzyme does not directly coordinate the zinc‐bound water in the same manner as the corresponding residue in human CA II, its location near the catalytic center is critical for maintaining the proper active site configuration. Such subtle differences illustrate how bacterial enzymes may tune catalytic efficiency and adapt their local environments, a conclusion supported by both crystallographic data and structure–function comparisons across different α‐CAs (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 8-9).

Beyond the residues directly involved in catalysis, structural integrity is vital for enzyme function—especially under thermophilic conditions. The tetrameric arrangement of T. ammonificans CA is stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. In studies of the tetrameric enzyme form, key cysteine residues such as Cys47 (and others implicated in disulfide formation) contribute significantly to thermostability. These disulfide bonds maintain the structural framework required for proper active site orientation and are critical for the enzyme’s ability to function at elevated temperatures (james2014thestructureof pages 7-8, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 27-29).

In summary, the essential residues in T. ammonificans CA (PDB 4C3T chain A) can be grouped as follows:

Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,H65,Dynamic proton shuttle involved in conformational switching and modulating the active site environment.,james2014thestructureof pages 11-12,literature,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,"The weight of the available evidence suggests two primary groups of residues in T. ammonificans α–carbonic anhydrase (TaCA; PDB 4C3T chain A) that are likely to participate in allosteric regulation or conformational switching.

First, a key residue identified by structural studies is the proton shuttle histidine. In the related tetrameric α–carbonic anhydrase study by James et al. (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12), His87 is highlighted as a dynamic residue whose side‐chain adopts different conformations (“in” versus “out”) depending on the bound ligand. In the inhibitor‐free and sulfanilamide-bound structures, His87 is modeled in the “out” conformation; however, in the acetazolamide-bound structure, mixed occupancy is observed with the majority (~60%) in the “in” conformation. Such behavior is consistent with a role in conformational switching because movement of His87 directly affects the architecture of the active site and the surrounding hydrogen‐bonding network that coordinates the catalytic Zn2+ ion. This dynamic reorientation is characteristic of a proton shuttle mechanism, which may allow the enzyme to actively regulate its catalytic cycle through allosteric changes. In summary, His87 operates not only in proton transfer but also as a conformational “switch” that can modulate both enzyme activity and substrate accessibility (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12).

Second, the unique quaternary structure of TaCA is maintained via a tetramerization interface formed through inter-subunit disulfide bonds. Multiple in silico studies of α–carbonic anhydrases from hydrothermal vent sources have noted that the conserved cysteine responsible for tetramer assembly is critical for thermostability and likely participates in allosteric regulation or conformational switching. Although an exact residue number is not uniformly stated in the context provided, the literature clearly points to a conserved cysteine residue—frequently cited (for example, as Cys67 in analogous enzymes from similar studies) – which forms a disulfide bond at the tetramerization interface. This bond not only stabilizes the overall architecture under high-temperature conditions but also may act as a pivot or “lock” that influences inter-subunit communication. Changes in the redox environment or local dynamic fluctuations at the tetramer interface could modulate the disulfide bond geometry, thereby propagating conformational changes between the subunits. The importance of such disulfide bonds in allosteric regulation is underscored by molecular dynamics and dynamic residue network analyses reported in studies investigating thermostability in CA enzymes (manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 1-3, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 5-8).

Together, these two classes of residues—His87 as a dynamic proton shuttle and the conserved disulfide-forming cysteine (e.g., Cys67)—establish a framework for allosteric behavior in TaCA. The proton shuttle His87 modulates the active site environment via distinct “in” and “out” conformations linked to enzyme activity, while the conserved cysteine contributes to the rigidity and overall multimer stability essential for inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation.

Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,H90,Coordinates catalytic zinc ion for activity.,james2014thestructureof pages 11-12,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"In Thermovibrio ammonificans carbonic anhydrase (TaCA) from PDB 4C3T chain A, ligand and substrate binding are orchestrated by an integrated network of residues that can be grouped into three functional categories: metal coordination, substrate orientation via a hydrophobic pocket, and proton transfer.

First, the catalytic zinc ion is critical for activity. In TaCA the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three highly conserved histidine residues—His112, His113, and His131. These residues directly ligate the metal, enabling activation of a zinc-bound water molecule that is deprotonated to form the reactive hydroxide ion responsible for nucleophilic attack on CO2. The importance of such zinc–histidine coordination is well established by crystallographic evidence and analogies with other α-carbonic anhydrases (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12).

Second, substrate binding specificity relies on a hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the zinc center to accommodate and orient the nonpolar CO2 molecule. In TaCA, this hydrophobic cavity is formed by the side chains of Val133, Val143, Leu197, Val206, and Trp209. These residues create a nonpolar environment that favors the binding of CO2 through van der Waals interactions, ensuring that the substrate is properly positioned for effective catalysis. The arrangement of these residues mirrors that seen in other well-studied carbonic anhydrases, thereby supporting their role in substrate specificity (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, krishnamurthy2008carbonicanhydraseas pages 12-13).

Third, the maintenance of catalytic turnover and efficient proton removal from the active site depend on a network of hydrophilic residues that facilitate proton shuttling. In TaCA, residues such as Tyr28 and Asn85 contribute to establishing a hydrogen-bonding network within the active site. Notably, Lys90 occupies a position analogous to asparagine seen in other carbonic anhydrases, indicating that while a lysine introduces a positive charge, it nevertheless supports proton transfer without hindering catalysis. Additionally, Thr198 and Thr199 are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the zinc-bound water or hydroxide, thereby stabilizing the transition state and directly influencing the binding geometry of substrates and inhibitors. Complementing this proton relay system is His87, which adopts multiple conformations (“in” and “out”) that are critical for transferring protons between the active site and the solvent. This dynamic behavior of His87 is key to sustaining catalytic efficiency (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, fisher2007speedingupproton pages 1-2).

Furthermore, studies of inhibitor binding (using azetazolamide, for example) indicate that additional residues, such as Gln110, contribute through hydrogen bonding interactions with the inhibitor’s sulfonamide group. The positioning of Gln110, in concert with His112, His114, His131, Leu197, Thr198, and Thr199, helps define the ligand-binding pocket and reinforces the specificity seen for structurally similar inhibitors (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6).

Collectively, these observations support an integrated mechanism in which metal coordination by His112, His113, and His131, substrate orientation via the hydrophobic cluster (Val133, Val143, Leu197, Val206, Trp209), and proton shuttling by key residues (Tyr28, Asn85, Lys90, Thr198, Thr199, and His87) work together to mediate ligand and substrate binding and specificity in T. ammonificans carbonic anhydrase.

Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,H109,Coordinates catalytic zinc ion for activity.,james2014thestructureof pages 11-12,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"In Thermovibrio ammonificans carbonic anhydrase (TaCA) from PDB 4C3T chain A, ligand and substrate binding are orchestrated by an integrated network of residues that can be grouped into three functional categories: metal coordination, substrate orientation via a hydrophobic pocket, and proton transfer.

First, the catalytic zinc ion is critical for activity. In TaCA the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three highly conserved histidine residues—His112, His113, and His131. These residues directly ligate the metal, enabling activation of a zinc-bound water molecule that is deprotonated to form the reactive hydroxide ion responsible for nucleophilic attack on CO2. The importance of such zinc–histidine coordination is well established by crystallographic evidence and analogies with other α-carbonic anhydrases (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12).

Second, substrate binding specificity relies on a hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the zinc center to accommodate and orient the nonpolar CO2 molecule. In TaCA, this hydrophobic cavity is formed by the side chains of Val133, Val143, Leu197, Val206, and Trp209. These residues create a nonpolar environment that favors the binding of CO2 through van der Waals interactions, ensuring that the substrate is properly positioned for effective catalysis. The arrangement of these residues mirrors that seen in other well-studied carbonic anhydrases, thereby supporting their role in substrate specificity (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, krishnamurthy2008carbonicanhydraseas pages 12-13).

Third, the maintenance of catalytic turnover and efficient proton removal from the active site depend on a network of hydrophilic residues that facilitate proton shuttling. In TaCA, residues such as Tyr28 and Asn85 contribute to establishing a hydrogen-bonding network within the active site. Notably, Lys90 occupies a position analogous to asparagine seen in other carbonic anhydrases, indicating that while a lysine introduces a positive charge, it nevertheless supports proton transfer without hindering catalysis. Additionally, Thr198 and Thr199 are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the zinc-bound water or hydroxide, thereby stabilizing the transition state and directly influencing the binding geometry of substrates and inhibitors. Complementing this proton relay system is His87, which adopts multiple conformations (“in” and “out”) that are critical for transferring protons between the active site and the solvent. This dynamic behavior of His87 is key to sustaining catalytic efficiency (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, fisher2007speedingupproton pages 1-2).

First, the catalytic zinc ion is critical for activity. In TaCA the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three highly conserved histidine residues—His112, His113, and His131. These residues directly ligate the metal, enabling activation of a zinc-bound water molecule that is deprotonated to form the reactive hydroxide ion responsible for nucleophilic attack on CO2. The importance of such zinc–histidine coordination is well established by crystallographic evidence and analogies with other α-carbonic anhydrases (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12).

Second, substrate binding specificity relies on a hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the zinc center to accommodate and orient the nonpolar CO2 molecule. In TaCA, this hydrophobic cavity is formed by the side chains of Val133, Val143, Leu197, Val206, and Trp209. These residues create a nonpolar environment that favors the binding of CO2 through van der Waals interactions, ensuring that the substrate is properly positioned for effective catalysis. The arrangement of these residues mirrors that seen in other well-studied carbonic anhydrases, thereby supporting their role in substrate specificity (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, krishnamurthy2008carbonicanhydraseas pages 12-13).

Third, the maintenance of catalytic turnover and efficient proton removal from the active site depend on a network of hydrophilic residues that facilitate proton shuttling. In TaCA, residues such as Tyr28 and Asn85 contribute to establishing a hydrogen-bonding network within the active site. Notably, Lys90 occupies a position analogous to asparagine seen in other carbonic anhydrases, indicating that while a lysine introduces a positive charge, it nevertheless supports proton transfer without hindering catalysis. Additionally, Thr198 and Thr199 are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the zinc-bound water or hydroxide, thereby stabilizing the transition state and directly influencing the binding geometry of substrates and inhibitors. Complementing this proton relay system is His87, which adopts multiple conformations (“in” and “out”) that are critical for transferring protons between the active site and the solvent. This dynamic behavior of His87 is key to sustaining catalytic efficiency (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, fisher2007speedingupproton pages 1-2).

Furthermore, studies of inhibitor binding (using azetazolamide, for example) indicate that additional residues, such as Gln110, contribute through hydrogen bonding interactions with the inhibitor’s sulfonamide group. The positioning of Gln110, in concert with His112, His114, His131, Leu197, Thr198, and Thr199, helps define the ligand-binding pocket and reinforces the specificity seen for structurally similar inhibitors (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6).

Zinc‐binding and catalytic activity are centered on a trio of highly conserved histidine residues. In TaCA these are most commonly numbered as His112, His113, and His131 (James2014thestructureof pages 11-12). They coordinate the catalytic Zn2+ ion, forming the essential active‐site framework required for CO2 hydration. This mode of metal coordination is conserved among bacterial α‐CAs, and similar residues have been identified in other homologues such as SspCA and SazCA (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9).

Structural stability is further reinforced by key disulfide bonds formed by conserved cysteine residues. Two cysteines, Cys47 and Cys202, form an intramolecular disulfide bond within each monomer, which plays an important role in rigidifying the protein scaffold (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9, james2014thestructureof pages 7-8). Uniquely, TaCA also contains a cysteine at position 67. Cys67 forms an inter-subunit disulfide bond that is critical for the tetrameric assembly of the enzyme; this oligomerization is linked directly to enhanced thermostability, as the intact disulfide promotes enzyme resilience at elevated temperatures (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 3-5).

Apart from the central active site and disulfide bonding, the hydrophobic environment that facilitates CO2 binding relies on conserved nonpolar side chains. In TaCA, methionine residues such as Met101—and in some homologues Met87—contribute to forming a hydrophobic pocket that stabilizes the reactive substrate within the active site (bishop2021…applicationsof pages 11-13).

Proton transfer dynamics are equally important for enzymatic activity. TaCA possesses crucial proton shuttle residues; among these, His87 is particularly notable. This residue, seen in multiple conformations, plays a key role in facilitating the transfer of protons away from the zinc-bound water/hydroxide, thereby optimizing catalysis (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12). Additionally, other residues such as Lys90 contribute indirectly by forming hydrogen bonds that guide protons, although in some homologues Lys90 may be substituted for asparagine without severe functional detriment (james2014thestructureof pages 11-12).

At the oligomeric interfaces, conserved charged and polar residues also participate in networked interactions that stabilize subunit association. In some homologues, residues like Asn49, Arg187, Ala237, and Arg238 have been identified as important interface residues through hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge formation (manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 8-9). Although these interface residues are more extensively discussed in comparative analyses, their conservation suggests that similar interactions contribute to TaCA’s quaternary structure stability.

In directed evolution studies, mutation of Asn187 to serine (N187S) had a pronounced effect on the enzyme’s stability and activity. Structural modeling revealed that N187 is located at the monomer–monomer interface and its substitution to serine modifies the local hydrogen‐bond network. This mutation influences the adjacent residue Glu163 by increasing its pKa from approximately 4.8 to 5.5, thereby reducing its acidity and favoring a more balanced local charge state. The change in local electrostatics appears to enhance both the unfolding free energy (ΔG°) and melting temperature (Tm), albeit modestly (around 1.5°C increase in Tm), thereby contributing to improved thermostability and ionic liquid tolerance (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 5-7).

Closely linked to N187 is Glu163. Although not mutated directly in the studies, E163 emerges as a functionally important residue because its pKa shift (mediated by the N187S mutation) suggests that inter-subunit ionic interactions are being fine-tuned. Comparative pKa analysis in other FDHs has shown that more thermostable enzymes tend to have glutamates with higher (more basic) pKa values, up to 6.2. This underscores the idea that maintaining a less acidic state at this position may be critical for retaining conformational stability under thermal stress (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 5-7).

Another residue implicated through directed evolution is Thr321. The mutation T321S was identified alongside N187S, and although its independent contribution appears to be secondary in terms of catalytic turnover, it is thought to modulate the structural context of the enzyme. T321S may complement the effect of N187S by subtly influencing the protein’s interface dynamics or solvent interactions, thereby indirectly contributing to improved thermostability (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 4-5, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 7-8).

In addition to these interfacial residues, two surface lysine residues identified through rational design and crystallographic studies—Lys47 and Lys328—play an important role in CbFDH thermostability. K47 was mutated to glutamate (K47E) to reduce surface entropy by replacing a charged and flexible residue with a less flexible one. This change resulted in improved local order and contributed to enhanced thermostability, as indicated by better activity retention at elevated temperatures (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4). Lys328 was mutated to valine (K328V), a substitution that also decreased the local conformational entropy. The K328V mutant exhibited significantly improved preservation of enzymatic activity at higher temperatures—with 70% residual activity recorded at 55°C compared to 50% for the native enzyme—and showed reduced disorder in adjacent secondary structural elements (specifically helix H1) as observed in high-resolution crystal structures, further underscoring its role in enhancing the enzyme’s Tm and ΔG° of unfolding (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4).

In summary, the influence on CbFDH thermostability in pdb 2FSS chain A is predominantly exerted by residues at the monomer interface (N187, which indirectly modulates E163, and T321) and by surface residues (K47 and K328) whose mutational modification reduces conformational flexibility. These targeted mutations alter the protein’s unfolding energetics, thus providing a strategy for enhancing enzyme robustness under industrial conditions (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2)."

Structural modeling revealed that N187 is located at the monomer–monomer interface and its substitution to serine modifies the local hydrogen‐bond network. This mutation influences the adjacent residue Glu163 by increasing its pKa from approximately 4.8 to 5.5, thereby reducing its acidity and favoring a more balanced local charge state. The change in local electrostatics appears to enhance both the unfolding free energy (ΔG°) and melting temperature (Tm), albeit modestly (around 1.5°C increase in Tm), thereby contributing to improved thermostability and ionic liquid tolerance (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 5-7).

Closely linked to N187 is Glu163. Although not mutated directly in the studies, E163 emerges as a functionally important residue because its pKa shift (mediated by the N187S mutation) suggests that inter-subunit ionic interactions are being fine-tuned. Comparative pKa analysis in other FDHs has shown that more thermostable enzymes tend to have glutamates with higher (more basic) pKa values, up to 6.2. This underscores the idea that maintaining a less acidic state at this position may be critical for retaining conformational stability under thermal stress (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 5-7).

Another residue implicated through directed evolution is Thr321. The mutation T321S was identified alongside N187S, and although its independent contribution appears to be secondary in terms of catalytic turnover, it is thought to modulate the structural context of the enzyme. T321S may complement the effect of N187S by subtly influencing the protein’s interface dynamics or solvent interactions, thereby indirectly contributing to improved thermostability (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 4-5, carter2014directedevolutionof pages 7-8).

In addition to these interfacial residues, two surface lysine residues identified through rational design and crystallographic studies—Lys47 and Lys328—play an important role in CbFDH thermostability. K47 was mutated to glutamate (K47E) to reduce surface entropy by replacing a charged and flexible residue with a less flexible one. This change resulted in improved local order and contributed to enhanced thermostability, as indicated by better activity retention at elevated temperatures (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4). Lys328 was mutated to valine (K328V), a substitution that also decreased the local conformational entropy. The K328V mutant exhibited significantly improved preservation of enzymatic activity at higher temperatures—with 70% residual activity recorded at 55°C compared to 50% for the native enzyme—and showed reduced disorder in adjacent secondary structural elements (specifically helix H1) as observed in high-resolution crystal structures, further underscoring its role in enhancing the enzyme’s Tm and ΔG° of unfolding (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4).

In summary, the influence on CbFDH thermostability in pdb 2FSS chain A is predominantly exerted by residues at the monomer interface (N187, which indirectly modulates E163, and T321) and by surface residues (K47 and K328) whose mutational modification reduces conformational flexibility. These targeted mutations alter the protein’s unfolding energetics, thus providing a strategy for enhancing enzyme robustness under industrial conditions (carter2014directedevolutionof pages 1-2, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2)."

Another residue of functional importance is Asp195. According to high‐resolution structural analyses, Asp195 interacts with parts of the NAD+ coenzyme, thereby conferring specificity for NAD+ over NADP+ and facilitating proper alignment for hydride transfer during catalysis. The structural role of Asp195 is underscored by its conserved position in related FDHs and its proximity to the glycine‐rich nucleotide‐binding motif (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8).

In addition to these, residues forming the conserved glycine‐rich motif (GXGXXG) are essential for establishing the Rossmann fold that binds the coenzyme.

In summary, the essential residues in C. boidinii FDH (pdb 2FSS chain A) that have key roles in catalytic and biochemical function include Arg174 (critical for NAD+ binding and overall catalysis), Asp195 (conferring coenzyme specificity), and the glycine residues of the GXGXXG motif (supporting the Rossmann fold), with additional supportive roles played by Lys47, Lys328, and other active‐site residues such as Asn118, Arg267, Gln278, and His310 (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10, ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8)."

Chemical modification experiments using the adenosine derivative AMPS‐HDB demonstrated that covalent modification of Arg174 leads to complete inactivation of the enzyme, confirming that its guanidinium side chain is essential for productive NAD+ binding, catalytic activity, and structural stability. In support of this, site‐directed mutagenesis replacing Arg174 with asparagine (Arg174Asn) not only rendered the enzyme resistant to AMPS‐HDB but also resulted in a dramatic (~32‐fold) increase in the Km for NAD+ and lowered thermostability, thereby affirming its multifunctional role (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10).

Another residue of functional importance is Asp195. According to high‐resolution structural analyses, Asp195 interacts with parts of the NAD+ coenzyme, thereby conferring specificity for NAD+ over NADP+ and facilitating proper alignment for hydride transfer during catalysis. The structural role of Asp195 is underscored by its conserved position in related FDHs and its proximity to the glycine‐rich nucleotide‐binding motif (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8).

In addition to these, residues forming the conserved glycine‐rich motif (GXGXXG) are essential for establishing the Rossmann fold that binds the coenzyme. Specifically, glycine residues such as Gly171, Gly173, and Gly176 provide the necessary conformational freedom and tight turn that allow the proper positioning of NAD+ and support the overall architecture of the nucleotide‐binding domain (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 2-5).

Furthermore, although not directly part of the active site in terms of catalysis, lysine residues like Lys47 and Lys328 have been implicated in biochemical function via structural stabilization and maintenance of the NAD+ binding domain’s architecture. Lys47, located near the active site cleft, and Lys328, whose mutation (K328V) was used to enhance crystallizability and overall enzyme stability, both contribute to the formation of a proper binding surface for the coenzyme and maintain protein solubility and rigidity necessary for efficient catalysis (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 1-2, guo2016enzymedynamicsand pages 37-41).

Additional residues such as Asn118, Arg267, Gln278, and His310 have also been indicated from complementary structural and mutagenesis studies to play roles in substrate binding and in stabilizing the transition state during the hydride transfer reaction. These residues contribute to the precise positioning of the substrate formate and the coenzyme within the active site and thereby influence catalytic efficiency (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49).

Formate dehydrogenase ( C. boidinii ),2FSS,A,R174,Essential for NAD⁺ binding via electrostatic interactions and ligand orientation.,"alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10",literature,R173N,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"The binding and specificity of ligands and substrates in Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase (CbFDH) in structure 2FSS chain A are primarily determined by a handful of conserved residues located in the NAD⁺ binding domain (the Rossmann fold) and in the active site cleft. The literature, based on crystallographic, chemical modification, and mutagenesis studies, converges on the following key residues:

1. Arg174  
Arg174 is perhaps the most critical residue identified. It is located in the Rossmann fold where it interacts directly with the NAD⁺ coenzyme. Structural data indicate that Arg174 is positioned to form a 2.94‐Å contact with the pyrophosphate moiety of NAD⁺, and its guanidinium group provides multiple electrostatic interactions that are essential for proper ligand orientation. Chemical modification studies using the nucleotide analogue AMPS-HDB provided direct evidence for its role; modification of Arg174 led to irreversible inactivation, and its replacement by asparagine (Arg174Asn) resulted in a dramatic 32‐fold increase in the Km for NAD⁺ along with impaired catalytic turnover and thermal stability. This combination of structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis evidence firmly establishes Arg174 as a central mediator of NAD⁺ binding specificity (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10).

2. Glycine Residues in the GXGXXG Motif (Gly171, Gly173, Gly176)  
These glycine residues are part of the conserved Rossmann “fingerprint” region. Their small side chains allow the formation of a tight phosphate-binding loop that is critical for proper folding of the NAD⁺ binding domain. The GXGXXG motif provides the necessary structural flexibility to accommodate the coenzyme, ensuring correct spatial orientation and close contact with the pyrophosphate group (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4).

3. Asn119  
Asn119 is positioned within the NAD⁺ binding domain and makes contacts with the bound coenzyme. Crystallographic analyses reveal that Asn119 is in proximity to the modeled NAD⁺ molecule, suggesting a role in stabilizing the adenine or ribose portions of the ligand. This residue helps to secure the NAD⁺ molecule in the active site, thereby contributing to ligand specificity (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 11-11).

4. Asp195  
Asp195 plays a decisive role in determining coenzyme specificity. By interacting with the O2′ phosphate group of the NAD⁺ ribose, Asp195 helps discriminate between NAD⁺ and NADP⁺, thereby influencing the enzyme’s cofactor preference. Structural comparisons and biochemical experiments have shown that alteration of this residue can switch coenzyme specificity, making it a critical determinant for the enzyme’s function (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5).

5. Arg258  
Arg258 is another residue that contacts the modeled NAD⁺ and/or inhibitors (such as azide in the ternary complex), forming salt bridges or hydrogen bonds that further stabilize the binding interaction. Its exact positioning is key for orienting the bound coenzyme correctly for catalysis (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 11-11).

6. His311  
Located near the substrate-binding site within the active site cleft, His311 is implicated in transition state stabilization during catalysis. Its proximity to bound substrate analogs suggests that, beyond simply binding NAD⁺, the enzyme employs His311 to facilitate hydride transfer from formate to NAD⁺, thus linking ligand binding to catalytic turnover (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8).

In summary, the evidence across multiple studies indicates that Arg174, in conjunction with the glycine residues of the Rossmann fold, Asn119, Asp195, Arg258, and His311, forms a network of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions that dictate both ligand/coenzyme binding and substrate specificity in CbFDH. Each of these residues has been characterized either structurally or biochemically (or both), and they appear consistently across detailed high-resolution crystallographic studies of PDB 2FSS chain A (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10, ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5)."

Arg258 is another residue that contacts the modeled NAD⁺ and/or inhibitors (such as azide in the ternary complex), forming salt bridges or hydrogen bonds that further stabilize the binding interaction. Its exact positioning is key for orienting the bound coenzyme correctly for catalysis (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 11-11).

6. His311  
Located near the substrate-binding site within the active site cleft, His311 is implicated in transition state stabilization during catalysis. Its proximity to bound substrate analogs suggests that, beyond simply binding NAD⁺, the enzyme employs His311 to facilitate hydride transfer from formate to NAD⁺, thus linking ligand binding to catalytic turnover (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8).

In summary, the evidence across multiple studies indicates that Arg174, in conjunction with the glycine residues of the Rossmann fold, Asn119, Asp195, Arg258, and His311, forms a network of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions that dictate both ligand/coenzyme binding and substrate specificity in CbFDH. Each of these residues has been characterized either structurally or biochemically (or both), and they appear consistently across detailed high-resolution crystallographic studies of PDB 2FSS chain A (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10, ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5)."

The literature, based on crystallographic, chemical modification, and mutagenesis studies, converges on the following key residues:

1. Arg174  
Arg174 is perhaps the most critical residue identified. It is located in the Rossmann fold where it interacts directly with the NAD⁺ coenzyme. Structural data indicate that Arg174 is positioned to form a 2.94‐Å contact with the pyrophosphate moiety of NAD⁺, and its guanidinium group provides multiple electrostatic interactions that are essential for proper ligand orientation. Chemical modification studies using the nucleotide analogue AMPS-HDB provided direct evidence for its role; modification of Arg174 led to irreversible inactivation, and its replacement by asparagine (Arg174Asn) resulted in a dramatic 32‐fold increase in the Km for NAD⁺ along with impaired catalytic turnover and thermal stability. This combination of structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis evidence firmly establishes Arg174 as a central mediator of NAD⁺ binding specificity (alqarni2021probingtherole pages 1-2, alqarni2021probingtherole pages 7-10).

2. Glycine Residues in the GXGXXG Motif (Gly171, Gly173, Gly176)  
These glycine residues are part of the conserved Rossmann “fingerprint” region. Their small side chains allow the formation of a tight phosphate-binding loop that is critical for proper folding of the NAD⁺ binding domain. The GXGXXG motif provides the necessary structural flexibility to accommodate the coenzyme, ensuring correct spatial orientation and close contact with the pyrophosphate group (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 2-4).

3. Asn119  
Asn119 is positioned within the NAD⁺ binding domain and makes contacts with the bound coenzyme. Crystallographic analyses reveal that Asn119 is in proximity to the modeled NAD⁺ molecule, suggesting a role in stabilizing the adenine or ribose portions of the ligand. This residue helps to secure the NAD⁺ molecule in the active site, thereby contributing to ligand specificity (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 11-11).

4. Asp195  
Asp195 plays a decisive role in determining coenzyme specificity. By interacting with the O2′ phosphate group of the NAD⁺ ribose, Asp195 helps discriminate between NAD⁺ and NADP⁺, thereby influencing the enzyme’s cofactor preference. Structural comparisons and biochemical experiments have shown that alteration of this residue can switch coenzyme specificity, making it a critical determinant for the enzyme’s function (ozgun2019proteinengineeringapplications pages 45-49, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5).

Formate dehydrogenase ( C. boidinii ),2FSS,A,F285,"Shields NAD⁺ from solvent, modulates catalytic efficiency and thermal stability.","bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2",literature,F284polar;F284charged,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,"Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase (CboFDH), as represented by PDB entry 2FSS chain A, contains several highly conserved residues that are crucial for both structural stability and catalytic function. Multiple high‐resolution structural studies and targeted mutagenesis experiments support the importance of these residues across FDH homologues.

One of the most prominently discussed residues is phenylalanine at position 285 (Phe285). This residue is structurally equivalent to phenylalanines found in FDHs from plants and bacteria and plays a dual role by shielding the coenzyme (NAD⁺) from solvent while also modulating catalytic efficiency and thermal stability. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in several FDHs demonstrate that substitutions at Phe285 lead to significant changes in substrate affinity and turnover as well as marked improvements in thermostability when replaced by polar or charged residues. The evidence clearly indicates that Phe285 is evolutionarily conserved and integral for maintaining the hydrophobic environment of the active site (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

In close proximity to Phe285, the invariant glutamine residue at position 287 (Gln287) has been identified as crucial for stabilizing the active-site microenvironment. Gln287, along with His311, replaces the typical His–Glu proton relay system found in other NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenases. Mutagenesis studies have shown that substituting Gln287 alters melting temperatures and optimum pH values, underscoring its role in both sustaining the proper conformation of the catalytic site and facilitating efficient substrate interaction (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, pages 11-14).

Another key residue is histidine at position 311 (His311). This residue functions as a general base during catalysis, and its spatial positioning is essential for maintaining the unprotonated state required for hydride transfer reactions. Mutation of His311 not only shifts the enzyme’s optimum temperature and pH toward more thermophilic and basic conditions, but also directly affects the catalytic turnover. These findings underscore that His311 is critical for the catalytic mechanism and structural robustness of CboFDH (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

Conserved cysteine residues also play a significant role in structural stability. Although the exact numbering in CboFDH PDB 2FSS chain A is not always explicitly given, it is well documented that free cysteine residues can be problematic for enzyme stability. Experimental replacement strategies aimed at inducing disulfide bond formation have demonstrated pronounced improvements in both activity and thermostability. Thus, conserved cysteines are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, even if their precise position in the sequence must be interpreted in the context of comparative FDH structures (altas2017heterologousproductionof pages 20-24, bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 14-14).

Additional evidence from high-resolution structural analyses identifies several other residues that contribute to both the structural core and the functional active site. For example, residues such as P68, N119, and V123 have been implicated in stabilizing the dimer interface and aiding in proper domain orientation. I175, together with R258 and P288, help construct the hydrophobic core and maintain the geometry of the active-site pocket essential for substrate binding. Furthermore, the catalytic aspartate residue D195 is conserved in the catalytic domain and is responsible for coenzyme specificity by interacting with the NAD⁺ adenine ribose. A conserved glycine triplet (G171–G176) forms part of the canonical (G/A)XGXXG motif, which is fundamental for the initiation of helix H9 and the proper folding of the NAD⁺ binding Rossmann fold (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9).

Collectively, the assembled evidence from structural studies and mutagenesis experiments demonstrates that residues Phe285, Gln287, and His311 are highly conserved and critically linked to both catalytic function and structural stability in CboFDH (Phe285, Gln287, His311: bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2). In addition, conserved cysteine residues, as well as the ancillary residues P68, N119, V123, I175, R258, P288, D195, and the glycine motif (G171–G176), underpin the enzyme’s overall framework, ensuring proper coenzyme binding, domain stabilization, and active-site geometry (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9)."

This residue is structurally equivalent to phenylalanines found in FDHs from plants and bacteria and plays a dual role by shielding the coenzyme (NAD⁺) from solvent while also modulating catalytic efficiency and thermal stability. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in several FDHs demonstrate that substitutions at Phe285 lead to significant changes in substrate affinity and turnover as well as marked improvements in thermostability when replaced by polar or charged residues. The evidence clearly indicates that Phe285 is evolutionarily conserved and integral for maintaining the hydrophobic environment of the active site (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

In close proximity to Phe285, the invariant glutamine residue at position 287 (Gln287) has been identified as crucial for stabilizing the active-site microenvironment. Gln287, along with His311, replaces the typical His–Glu proton relay system found in other NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenases. Mutagenesis studies have shown that substituting Gln287 alters melting temperatures and optimum pH values, underscoring its role in both sustaining the proper conformation of the catalytic site and facilitating efficient substrate interaction (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, pages 11-14).

Another key residue is histidine at position 311 (His311). This residue functions as a general base during catalysis, and its spatial positioning is essential for maintaining the unprotonated state required for hydride transfer reactions. Mutation of His311 not only shifts the enzyme’s optimum temperature and pH toward more thermophilic and basic conditions, but also directly affects the catalytic turnover. These findings underscore that His311 is critical for the catalytic mechanism and structural robustness of CboFDH (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

Conserved cysteine residues also play a significant role in structural stability. Although the exact numbering in CboFDH PDB 2FSS chain A is not always explicitly given, it is well documented that free cysteine residues can be problematic for enzyme stability. Experimental replacement strategies aimed at inducing disulfide bond formation have demonstrated pronounced improvements in both activity and thermostability. Thus, conserved cysteines are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, even if their precise position in the sequence must be interpreted in the context of comparative FDH structures (altas2017heterologousproductionof pages 20-24, bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 14-14).

Additional evidence from high-resolution structural analyses identifies several other residues that contribute to both the structural core and the functional active site. For example, residues such as P68, N119, and V123 have been implicated in stabilizing the dimer interface and aiding in proper domain orientation. I175, together with R258 and P288, help construct the hydrophobic core and maintain the geometry of the active-site pocket essential for substrate binding. Furthermore, the catalytic aspartate residue D195 is conserved in the catalytic domain and is responsible for coenzyme specificity by interacting with the NAD⁺ adenine ribose. A conserved glycine triplet (G171–G176) forms part of the canonical (G/A)XGXXG motif, which is fundamental for the initiation of helix H9 and the proper folding of the NAD⁺ binding Rossmann fold (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9).

Collectively, the assembled evidence from structural studies and mutagenesis experiments demonstrates that residues Phe285, Gln287, and His311 are highly conserved and critically linked to both catalytic function and structural stability in CboFDH (Phe285, Gln287, His311: bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2). In addition, conserved cysteine residues, as well as the ancillary residues P68, N119, V123, I175, R258, P288, D195, and the glycine motif (G171–G176), underpin the enzyme’s overall framework, ensuring proper coenzyme binding, domain stabilization, and active-site geometry (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9)."

A conserved glycine triplet (G171–G176) forms part of the canonical (G/A)XGXXG motif, which is fundamental for the initiation of helix H9 and the proper folding of the NAD⁺ binding Rossmann fold (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9).

Collectively, the assembled evidence from structural studies and mutagenesis experiments demonstrates that residues Phe285, Gln287, and His311 are highly conserved and critically linked to both catalytic function and structural stability in CboFDH (Phe285, Gln287, His311: bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2). In addition, conserved cysteine residues, as well as the ancillary residues P68, N119, V123, I175, R258, P288, D195, and the glycine motif (G171–G176), underpin the enzyme’s overall framework, ensuring proper coenzyme binding, domain stabilization, and active-site geometry (schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 4-5, schirwitz2007high‐resolutionstructuresof pages 5-8, lamzin1994nad(+)dependentformate pages 8-9)."

Multiple high‐resolution structural studies and targeted mutagenesis experiments support the importance of these residues across FDH homologues.

One of the most prominently discussed residues is phenylalanine at position 285 (Phe285). This residue is structurally equivalent to phenylalanines found in FDHs from plants and bacteria and plays a dual role by shielding the coenzyme (NAD⁺) from solvent while also modulating catalytic efficiency and thermal stability. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in several FDHs demonstrate that substitutions at Phe285 lead to significant changes in substrate affinity and turnover as well as marked improvements in thermostability when replaced by polar or charged residues. The evidence clearly indicates that Phe285 is evolutionarily conserved and integral for maintaining the hydrophobic environment of the active site (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

In close proximity to Phe285, the invariant glutamine residue at position 287 (Gln287) has been identified as crucial for stabilizing the active-site microenvironment. Gln287, along with His311, replaces the typical His–Glu proton relay system found in other NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenases. Mutagenesis studies have shown that substituting Gln287 alters melting temperatures and optimum pH values, underscoring its role in both sustaining the proper conformation of the catalytic site and facilitating efficient substrate interaction (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, pages 11-14).

Another key residue is histidine at position 311 (His311). This residue functions as a general base during catalysis, and its spatial positioning is essential for maintaining the unprotonated state required for hydride transfer reactions. Mutation of His311 not only shifts the enzyme’s optimum temperature and pH toward more thermophilic and basic conditions, but also directly affects the catalytic turnover. These findings underscore that His311 is critical for the catalytic mechanism and structural robustness of CboFDH (bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 1-3, tishkov2015roleofa pages 1-2).

Conserved cysteine residues also play a significant role in structural stability. Although the exact numbering in CboFDH PDB 2FSS chain A is not always explicitly given, it is well documented that free cysteine residues can be problematic for enzyme stability. Experimental replacement strategies aimed at inducing disulfide bond formation have demonstrated pronounced improvements in both activity and thermostability. Thus, conserved cysteines are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, even if their precise position in the sequence must be interpreted in the context of comparative FDH structures (altas2017heterologousproductionof pages 20-24, bulut2021conservedaminoacid pages 14-14).

Additional evidence from high-resolution structural analyses identifies several other residues that contribute to both the structural core and the functional active site. For example, residues such as P68, N119, and V123 have been implicated in stabilizing the dimer interface and aiding in proper domain orientation. I175, together with R258 and P288, help construct the hydrophobic core and maintain the geometry of the active-site pocket essential for substrate binding.

Glucose dehydrogenase ( B. megaterium ),3AUT,A,E171,Key residue at subunit interface; E170K mutation improves thermostability via electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions.,"baik2003significantlyenhancedstability pages 4-6, baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9",literature,E169K,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The dominant residues shown to affect the thermostability of Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) in the PDB 3AUT chain A structure are glutamate 170 (E170) and glutamine 252 (Q252). In several studies these two residues have been mutated—E170 to lysine (E170K) and Q252 to leucine (Q252L)—with dramatic improvements in enzyme stability. 

E170 in the wild-type enzyme is located at the subunit–subunit interface, where its negative charge contributes to less favorable electrostatic interactions under conditions such as alkaline pH. By substituting glutamate with lysine, a positively charged residue, the mutation (E170K) reverses potentially destabilizing interactions and facilitates the formation of new direct hydrogen bonds, for example with glycine 241 (G241), which are absent in the native enzyme. This improved intersubunit association is directly correlated with enhanced thermostability and stabilization of the quaternary structure. Notably, the E170K mutation increases resistance to unfolding at high temperature and alkaline pH by reducing water-mediated disruptions and improving interface packing (baik2003significantlyenhancedstability pages 4-6, baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9).

Q252 is situated in a hydrophobic cavity at the interface between subunits, and in the wild-type enzyme, the polar glutamine at this position contributes to water accessibility that may undermine hydrophobic packing. The Q252L mutation replaces glutamine with the more hydrophobic leucine. This substitution eliminates the polar carbonyl group and consequently displaces water molecules from the interface, resulting in tighter hydrophobic interactions that reinforce the oligomer’s stability. Enhanced packing through Q252L translates to an increased melting temperature (T_m) and a higher free energy of unfolding (ΔG°) as the enzyme is better shielded from thermal denaturation (baik2003significantlyenhancedstability pages 4-6, baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9).

Beyond these primary sites, additional mutations have been explored in engineered variants of GlcDH that combine E170K and Q252L with changes at other positions. For example, variants constructed by Vazquez-Figueroa and colleagues included mutations at positions P45, N46, F155, V227, and W230 in addition to E170K and Q252L. These residues, when substituted (for example, P45A, N46E, F155Y, V227A, W230F), contribute cumulatively to increased thermostability by further modulating the enzyme’s surface and packing characteristics. However, the pivotal thermostability gains—reflected in greatly increased half-life at harsh conditions and inferred improvements in T_m and ΔG°—are primarily attributed to the cooperative effects of the E170K and Q252L mutations (vazquezfigueroa2008thermostablevariantsconstructed pages 3-4).

In summary, the evidence from directed evolution studies and structural analyses converge on the conclusion that E170 and Q252 are key residues affecting thermostability in Bacillus megaterium GlcDH.

Glucose dehydrogenase ( B. megaterium ),3AUT,A,K163,"Part of the conserved Tyr–Ser–Lys catalytic triad, essential for substrate and cofactor alignment and hydride transfer.",Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"Based on the available structural and biochemical evidence in the provided literature, the essential catalytic and biochemical residues in Bacillus megaterium Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from pdb 3AUT chain A can be inferred primarily on the basis of conserved features of short‐chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) and from direct experimental data on this enzyme. In particular, two lysine residues have been identified with direct evidence for their critical roles:

1. K162 is essential because it is part of the highly conserved Tyr–Ser–Lys catalytic triad found in SDR enzymes. This lysine plays a dual role in aligning both the glucose substrate and NAD+ cofactor at the active site, thereby facilitating proper substrate positioning and hydride transfer. Modification of K162, for example during covalent immobilization, results in partial enzyme deactivation, underscoring its catalytic importance (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14).

2. K199 is also highlighted as a key lysine residue. Its role is primarily in substrate and cofactor binding, which is necessary to maintain the active site architecture for effective catalysis. Experiments that target K199 have shown that any modification adversely affects the enzyme’s activity (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14).

Because GDH is a member of the SDR family, additional catalytic residues can be inferred by homology with other SDR enzymes. Although specific residue numbers (other than K162 and K199) are not explicitly provided for pdb 3AUT chain A, the conserved catalytic mechanism of SDRs furnishes us with reasonable predictions:

3. A catalytic tyrosine is typically found within a conserved Y–X–X–X–K motif that is crucial for proton abstraction during the oxidation reaction. In many SDRs, this tyrosine functions as the catalytic base. For example, in a related enzyme discussed in Conradt (2017), a similar tyrosine residue acts to facilitate hydride transfer from the substrate to the NAD(P)+ cofactor (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95, 100-104).

4. A serine residue (analogous to S154 in other related bacterial SDRs) is expected to be present in the active site. This serine residue is involved in stabilizing the transition state or the substrate via hydrogen bonding. Although direct residue numbering for GDH in pdb 3AUT is not provided, the conservation of the Tyr–Ser–Lys triad suggests that an equivalent serine is critically important (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95).

5. An aspartate residue (similar to D125 described in related SDR systems) may also contribute by participating in a catalytic tetrad that assists in proton shuttling and stabilization of reaction intermediates. Such aspartate residues are commonly seen in SDR enzymes and are assumed to have a supporting catalytic role (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95).

Further support for these assignments comes from comparative structural alignments with other SDR enzymes. Studies by Gangwar et al. (2020) indicate that analogous enzymes, such as MtbDprE2, employ a catalytic triad that includes serine, tyrosine, and lysine (with additional residues like aspartate from the glycine-rich NADH-binding motif), though the numbers in that system (e.g., Ser147, Tyr160, Lys164) are provided in a different context. These residues, by homology, support the view that in B. megaterium GDH the well‐conserved triad is central to its catalytic function (Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 10-13, 13-17).

In summary, while the explicit mapping for pdb 3AUT chain A is not exhaustively detailed in the excerpts, the combination of direct experimental evidence and the strong conservation found in the SDR enzyme family lead us to conclude that:

Glucose dehydrogenase ( B. megaterium ),3AUT,A,K200,"Key for substrate and cofactor binding, maintaining active site architecture for catalysis.",Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"Based on the available structural and biochemical evidence in the provided literature, the essential catalytic and biochemical residues in Bacillus megaterium Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from pdb 3AUT chain A can be inferred primarily on the basis of conserved features of short‐chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) and from direct experimental data on this enzyme. In particular, two lysine residues have been identified with direct evidence for their critical roles:

1. K162 is essential because it is part of the highly conserved Tyr–Ser–Lys catalytic triad found in SDR enzymes. This lysine plays a dual role in aligning both the glucose substrate and NAD+ cofactor at the active site, thereby facilitating proper substrate positioning and hydride transfer. Modification of K162, for example during covalent immobilization, results in partial enzyme deactivation, underscoring its catalytic importance (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14).

2. K199 is also highlighted as a key lysine residue. Its role is primarily in substrate and cofactor binding, which is necessary to maintain the active site architecture for effective catalysis. Experiments that target K199 have shown that any modification adversely affects the enzyme’s activity (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14).

Because GDH is a member of the SDR family, additional catalytic residues can be inferred by homology with other SDR enzymes. Although specific residue numbers (other than K162 and K199) are not explicitly provided for pdb 3AUT chain A, the conserved catalytic mechanism of SDRs furnishes us with reasonable predictions:

3. A catalytic tyrosine is typically found within a conserved Y–X–X–X–K motif that is crucial for proton abstraction during the oxidation reaction. In many SDRs, this tyrosine functions as the catalytic base. For example, in a related enzyme discussed in Conradt (2017), a similar tyrosine residue acts to facilitate hydride transfer from the substrate to the NAD(P)+ cofactor (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95, 100-104).

4. A serine residue (analogous to S154 in other related bacterial SDRs) is expected to be present in the active site. This serine residue is involved in stabilizing the transition state or the substrate via hydrogen bonding. Although direct residue numbering for GDH in pdb 3AUT is not provided, the conservation of the Tyr–Ser–Lys triad suggests that an equivalent serine is critically important (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95).

5. An aspartate residue (similar to D125 described in related SDR systems) may also contribute by participating in a catalytic tetrad that assists in proton shuttling and stabilization of reaction intermediates. Such aspartate residues are commonly seen in SDR enzymes and are assumed to have a supporting catalytic role (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95).

Further support for these assignments comes from comparative structural alignments with other SDR enzymes. Studies by Gangwar et al. (2020) indicate that analogous enzymes, such as MtbDprE2, employ a catalytic triad that includes serine, tyrosine, and lysine (with additional residues like aspartate from the glycine-rich NADH-binding motif), though the numbers in that system (e.g., Ser147, Tyr160, Lys164) are provided in a different context. These residues, by homology, support the view that in B. megaterium GDH the well‐conserved triad is central to its catalytic function (Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 10-13, 13-17).

In summary, while the explicit mapping for pdb 3AUT chain A is not exhaustively detailed in the excerpts, the combination of direct experimental evidence and the strong conservation found in the SDR enzyme family lead us to conclude that:
• K162 and K199 are the most directly supported essential residues for substrate–cofactor alignment and catalysis.
• A catalytic tyrosine, a serine, and likely an aspartate residue—consistent with the canonical active site motifs in SDRs—are inferred to be essential for the catalytic mechanism, even though their exact residue numbers in GDH from B. megaterium are not provided in the current texts (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14, Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95, 100-104, Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 10-13)."
Glucose dehydrogenase ( B. megaterium ),3AUT,A,E171,Contributes to subunit association and stabilizes inter-subunit contacts via hydrogen bonding.,baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9,literature,E169K,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,"The strongest experimental evidence provided in the available context identifies two key residues in Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase (PDB 3AUT chain A) that participate in processes affecting both oligomer stabilization and allosteric regulation via conformational integrity. These residues are Glutamate 170 (E170) and Glutamine 252 (Q252).

E170 is located near the interface between subunits A and B. In the wild‐type enzyme, this residue contributes to subunit association by positioning itself in an area where a strategic hydrogen‐bonding network is critical for interface stabilization. When mutated to lysine (E170K), a new hydrogen bond is formed with Glycine 241 (G241). This salt‐bridge/hydrogen bond interaction not only enhances the enzyme’s stability at alkaline pHs but also reinforces the inter-subunit contacts that are essential for maintaining the proper quaternary structure. Because the conformational integrity of the oligomer is a prerequisite for proper enzyme function, changes at this position are linked to effects that can be interpreted as allosteric regulation, where stabilization indirectly supports a conformational state that is catalytically competent (baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9).

Q252 is situated at the interface between subunits A and D, near the P axis. In the native enzyme, this residue contributes to the maintenance of the tetrameric state by modulating the local environment near residue Y253. Replacement of glutamine with leucine (Q252L) introduces a hydrophobic side chain that enhances local hydrophobic interactions, notably with threonine 251 (T251), which stabilizes the interface. The increased hydrophobicity as a result of the Q252L mutation favors a more stable oligomeric configuration, which is known to correlate with enhanced thermostability. Although not acting as a direct allosteric effector (i.e., there is not a classic effector-binding event at Q252), its role in maintaining the active, oligomeric state has an indirect impact on the enzyme’s overall conformational landscape and hence its capacity to respond to other regulatory signals (baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9).

It is noteworthy that sequence alignments with other short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases reveal that the residues equivalent to E170 and Q252 are highly conserved. This conservation underscores the functional importance of these positions—not only for maintaining quaternary structure but also for ensuring that the protein can safely accommodate the necessary conformational transitions that underlie allosteric regulation.

While other studies in the provided context (e.g., those focusing on ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, UDP-glucose dehydrogenases, and UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases) detail residues such as those in the Thr131-loop or α6 switch helix that mediate conformational switching in homologous systems, no additional residues in Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase itself were specifically implicated in these processes beyond E170 and Q252. Thus, based on the direct crystallographic and mutagenesis evidence available, E170 and Q252 are the principal residues that participate in allosteric regulation or conformational switching in this enzyme (baik2005cooperativeeffectof pages 7-9)."

In GDH, the catalytic triad is typically composed of a serine (Ser), a tyrosine (Tyr), and a lysine (Lys) residue. Although the exact numbering for the serine and tyrosine in this enzyme is not uniformly detailed in the available literature, evidence from structural and mutagenesis studies strongly supports that one lysine residue from this triad is directly involved in substrate orientation and cofactor (NAD/NADP) binding (Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 20-23).

Spano et al. (2020) provide some of the most explicit residue-level evidence from experimental immobilization studies. Their work identifies two key lysine residues, K162 and K199, which are located in the active site of the enzyme. Lysine K162 is proposed to be part of the conserved Tyr-Ser-Lys catalytic triad. This residue is critical for mediating hydrogen bond interactions that help to position both the glucose substrate and the NAD+ coenzyme accurately in the active site, thereby facilitating the catalytic conversion (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14). In parallel, lysine K199 is also situated in the active site where it contributes to substrate alignment through similar interactions. Its modification during immobilization experiments significantly reduced enzyme activity, underscoring its functional role in catalysis and substrate binding specificity (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14).

Additional structural comparisons, especially those discussed by Conradt (2017), indicate that while the conserved Rossmann fold maintains NAD(P)H binding, the variable or flexible C-terminal segment—often referred to as the substrate‐binding loop—plays a major role in determining substrate promiscuity versus specificity. Although Conradt (2017) does not list individual residues for GDH in 3AUT, the analysis on similar SDR enzymes suggests that variations in the amino acid composition of this loop create a distinct environment that governs ligand binding interactions (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionof pages 91-95). This concept is further supported by Gangwar et al. (2020), where structure‐guided mutagenesis experiments highlight that even minor modifications in the substrate-binding pocket, including residues in the flexible C-terminal region, can dramatically alter substrate specificity (Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 20-23).

Additionally, while the explicit positions of the serine and tyrosine residues in the catalytic triad remain less clearly defined in the provided excerpts, the canonical nature of SDR enzymes implies that these residues operate in tandem with K162. By establishing critical hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, the serine and tyrosine residues not only support catalytic turnover but also contribute to fine-tuning the substrate orientation within the active site (Conradt2017biocatalyticreductionofa pages 91-95).

In summary, the effective catalysis and substrate discrimination in Bacillus megaterium GDH (PDB 3AUT, chain A) are most convincingly mediated by lysine K162—integral to the conserved catalytic triad—and lysine K199, which is also essential for ligand alignment. Meanwhile, the flexible C-terminal ligand-binding loop is presumed to harbor additional residues that modulate substrate specificity but require further detailed residue mapping for complete elucidation (Spano20203dprintedlabwarefor pages 11-14, Gangwar2020structuralstudiesonm. pages 20-23)."

In particular, sequence alignment with homologous dehydrogenases (e.g., TBADH) indicates that several key residues involved in forming inter- and intra‐subunit ion pairs are critical.

One of the most compelling lines of evidence comes from the comparison of TBADH and CBADH, where residues such as glutamate 165 (E165) and arginine 304 (R304) form an intersubunit ion pair that bridges the A and D subunits. In TBADH, additional charged residues, notably aspartate 237 (D237) and lysine 257 (K257), along with intrasubunit pairs such as aspartate 163 (D163) and lysine 291 (K291) are observed. These residues together create an extensive network of ion pairs that significantly raise the melting temperature and increase the ΔG° of unfolding by restricting flexibility at the subunit interfaces (korkhin1999oligomericintegrity—thestructural pages 2-3).

Further, the alignment with Fe-ADH suggests that similar positions in the T. maritima enzyme are likely to be occupied by analogous charged residues. These residues are thought to provide enhanced electrostatic interactions that are especially important under extreme thermal conditions. In related thermophilic enzymes, the prevalence of charged residues (e.g., arginine, lysine, aspartate, and glutamate) forming stable salt bridges has been correlated with high T_m values and favorable folding free energies (bozanic2013proteinstabilityin pages 42-45, jaenicke2001[33]thermostabilityof pages 23-25).

In addition to charged interactions, specific proline residues are instrumental due to their unique conformational rigidity. For example, proline at position 222 (P222) plays a dual role—it both stabilizes the dipole of an adjacent alpha helix and restricts local flexibility, thereby decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state. Such proline substitutions have proven to be a recurrent theme in the conversion of mesophilic enzymes into forms with higher thermal stability, as evidenced in studies comparing CBADH and TBADH where extra prolines substantially increased thermostability (korkhin1999oligomericintegrity—thestructural pages 1-2, bogin1998enhancedthermalstability pages 1-2).

Another cluster of residues within the region spanning positions 223–254, including substitutions like V224E (replacement of a valine with a glutamate) and S254K (substitution of serine with lysine), appears to contribute to improved helix stabilization. These changes enhance hydrophobic contacts and reinforce favorable ion pairing at the subunit interfaces, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the oligomer (korkhin1999oligomericintegrity—thestructural pages 2-3, 5-7).

While direct mutagenesis data for T. maritima’s Fe-ADH are not as detailed as for TBADH/CBADH, the strong sequence and structural parallels imply that the mentioned residues—E165, R304, D237, K257, D163, K291, and P222, as well as those in the 223–254 region (including V224E and S254K)—are key contributors to thermostability.

In this enzyme the iron ion is coordinated by four key residues, which according to the crystallographic evidence are Asp189, His193, His256, and His270. These residues are arranged so that their side chains ligate the Fe2+ ion, thus establishing the precise geometry required for efficient electron transfer during oxidation/reduction reactions.

In addition to these iron‐coordinating residues, the enzyme features a conserved coenzyme-binding motif in its N-terminal α/β domain. This motif is formed by a short stretch of residues—specifically a “GGGGS” sequence, sometimes reported as Gly39‐Gly40‐Gly41‐Ser42—which is directly involved in binding the NAD(P)+ cofactor. This cofactor is essential for the redox reaction because it serves as a hydride donor or acceptor in the catalytic cycle.

In addition to these iron‐coordinating residues, the enzyme features a conserved coenzyme-binding motif in its N-terminal α/β domain. This motif is formed by a short stretch of residues—specifically a “GGGGS” sequence, sometimes reported as Gly39‐Gly40‐Gly41‐Ser42—which is directly involved in binding the NAD(P)+ cofactor. This cofactor is essential for the redox reaction because it serves as a hydride donor or acceptor in the catalytic cycle. The conservation of this motif across several hyperthermophilic iron‐dependent alcohol dehydrogenases has been noted by multiple studies, underscoring its role in ensuring accurate coenzyme binding and proper positioning relative to the reactive iron center (Hao2009MolecularCharacterizationOf pages 164-171, Lin2024NewInsightsInto pages 1-6).

Mutagenesis studies in related enzymes have further validated the critical nature of these residues. For instance, when residues analogous to Asp189, His193, His256, and His270 have been mutated in homologous systems, the loss or significant reduction in enzyme activity has been observed—demonstrating that these amino acids are indispensable for both metal coordination and overall catalysis (Larson2019TheStructureOf pages 5-7, Lin2024NewInsightsInto pages 11-15). Although some reports derived from similar enzymes have proposed alternative numbering (for example, Asp193, His197, His260, and His272), the crystal structure of T. maritima’s Fe-ADH in 1O2D chain A is most consistently interpreted with the residues Asp189, His193, His256, and His270 fulfilling these roles (Schwarzenbacher2004CrystalStructureOf pages 1-3, Lin2024NewInsightsInto pages 6-11).

In summary, the essential residues in the T. maritima Fe‐alcohol dehydrogenase that contribute to its catalytic and biochemical function are:
• Asp189 – serves as a key metal‐ligand, anchoring the Fe2+ ion in the active site.
• His193 – forms part of the coordination sphere required for proper Fe2+ binding.
• His256 – contributes to the metal coordination geometry that is critical for electron transfer.
• His270 – completes the quartet of iron‐binding residues needed to maintain the catalytic structure.

Fe-alcohol dehydrogenase ( T. maritima ),1O2D,A,S40,Part of conserved NADP binding motif essential for cofactor interaction.,"hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171, lin2024newinsightsinto pages 15-19",literature,,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,"The available structural and sequence data for the Fe‐alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (PDB 1O2D, chain A) consistently highlight a set of four key active‐site residues that are highly conserved among homologues and are crucial both for catalytic function and for maintaining structural integrity under hyperthermophilic conditions.

One critical residue is an aspartate found in the active‐site motif. Hao2009molecularcharacterizationof reports this Asp residue as Asp195, whereas Lin2024newinsightsinto (pages 11-15) and (pages 6-11) identify it as Asp193 or Asp189 in slightly different numbering schemes. Regardless of minor numbering differences, the acidic side chain of this residue is essential for coordinating the Fe2+ ion in the enzyme’s C-terminal domain. Its carboxylate group forms one of the ligands in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry that is pivotal for both electron transfer during catalysis and stabilization of the metallocenter (hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171, lin2024newinsightsinto pages 11-15).

Coupled with the aspartate, a histidine residue immediately following it is also highly conserved. In one report, this is His199 (hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171) and in Lin2024newinsightsinto it is noted as His197 (pages 11-15). The imidazole side chain of this histidine plays a dual role. First, it provides one of the nitrogen ligands necessary for iron coordination. Second, by contributing to the precise geometric arrangement of the active site, it supports optimal substrate positioning and the enzyme’s thermostability under high‐temperature conditions (lin2024newinsightsinto pages 11-15).

In addition to these two residues, two further histidines are consistently cited. Hao2009molecularcharacterizationof points to His268 and His282, while Lin2024newinsightsinto documents equivalent positions – His260 and His272 (pages 11-15) and even mentions His256 and His270 in an alternative description (pages 6-11) – as conserved. The role of these histidines is to provide additional nitrogen ligands in the iron coordination sphere. Their spatial arrangement establishes a trigonal bipyramidal or tetrahedral geometry (depending on the precise coordination environment and enzyme state), which is central to the catalytic reduction or oxidation reactions that the enzyme mediates. This coordination also not only stabilizes the iron ion but also preserves active‐site architecture against the denaturing effects of high thermal energy (hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171, lin2024newinsightsinto pages 11-15, lin2024newinsightsinto pages 6-11).

Moreover, it is important to note that the enzyme structure is organized into two domains. The N-terminal domain contains a conserved NADP binding motif (Gly39-Gly40-Gly41-Ser42 reported in hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171 and lin2024newinsightsinto pages 15-19) which, while not directly coordinating iron, is essential for cofactor interaction that influences overall enzyme stability and function. This motif indirectly contributes to the proper positioning of the catalytic domain (with the four key residues) to ensure efficient electron transfer and catalysis.

The cumulative evidence from multiple studies—including structural analyses from Hao2009molecularcharacterizationof, detailed residue comparisons in Lin2024newinsightsinto (with several page references), and supportive insights from crystallographic studies on homologous enzymes (montella…Unknownyearcrystalstructureof pages 4-6)—strongly underlines that these conserved aspartate and histidine residues (Asp195/193/189, His199/197, His268/260/256, and His282/272/270) are indispensable to the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism and its thermal stability (hao2009molecularcharacterizationof pages 164-171, lin2024newinsightsinto pages 11-15, montella…Unknownyearcrystalstructureof pages 4-6)."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase ( T. thermophilus ),6FKU,A,Q510,"Forms hydrogen bond with Ala465, stabilizing the substrate tunnel and tetramer integrity.",brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11,literature,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The cumulative evidence indicates that specific residues in the C-terminal extension and its associated intersubunit interfaces in ALDHTt (P. thermophilus Aldehyde dehydrogenase, PDB 6FKU chain A) are critical for thermostability. In particular, multiple studies show that residues forming the “Notch” and “Crook” regions and their interacting partners significantly affect the melting temperature (Tm) and the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔG°).

One key residue is Gln510. In the full‐length enzyme, Gln510 participates in a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network by interacting directly with Ala465 on the aldehyde anchor loop. This interaction effectively “caps” the substrate tunnel, fostering a closed conformation that maintains tetramer integrity and resists thermal denaturation. Experimental truncation of the C-terminal tail, which removes Gln510, results in an open substrate tunnel, increased exposure of hydrophilic residues, and a measurable drop in Tm (from 84 °C in the native enzyme to approximately 80 °C or lower in truncated forms). This clearly shows that Gln510 is indispensable for preserving the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Ala465 itself is another residue that is central to this stabilizing network. Its hydrogen bond with Gln510 secures the positioning of the C-terminal tail across the active site, thereby indirectly setting the stage for subsequent oligomeric interactions and thermal resistance. The loss of this bond upon truncation weakens the subunit interactions and promotes aggregation under heat stress (brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Additional residues external to the C-terminal tail also play important roles. Notably, Arg126 and Glu136 are positioned in the oligomerization domain where they form a salt bridge that is critical for maintaining intersubunit contacts. This salt bridge anchors the C-terminal extension in an orientation that reinforces the tetrameric assembly, thereby enhancing thermostability by increasing ΔG° of unfolding. Disruption of these electrostatic interactions—either by truncation or mutation—leads to a destabilization of the quaternary structure, as evidenced by both a decrease in the melting temperature and more rapid thermal aggregation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Lys105 also contributes to thermostability by packing against the negatively charged “hook” of the C-terminal tail. Its interaction prevents the tail from inappropriately folding into the interdomain cleft, a misfolding event that would otherwise compromise the structural integrity of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Furthermore, residues at the very beginning of the C-terminal extension, such as Ser503 and Gly504 (collectively termed the “Notch” region), initiate the proper trajectory of the tail. Their role is to direct the tail perpendicular to the substrate tunnel, ensuring that it adopts a conformation conducive to stabilizing the tetramer rather than interfering with catalytic access. Although these residues do not directly contribute to thermodynamic unfolding parameters, their impact on overall oligomer stability indirectly supports a higher Tm (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

Lastly, the “Crook” region (comprising Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) forms the tip of the C-terminal tail. This region is crucial not only for occluding the substrate access channel but also for creating a network of stabilizing interactions across subunits. Disruption of these residues through truncation leads not only to enhanced catalytic activity (due to better substrate accessibility) but also to compromised structural stability, reinforcing the idea that these residues are key thermostability determinants (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

In summary, the interplay between residues in the C-terminal extension (Ser503, Gly504, Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) and their interaction partners (notably Ala465, Arg126, Glu136, and Lys105) forms a robust network that enhances thermostability by maintaining the tetrameric assembly and increasing the ΔG° of unfolding, effectively raising the enzyme’s melting temperature (T_m). This integrated stabilizing mechanism is well supported by both mutational and biophysical studies (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, brytan2024contributionofa pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8)."

One key residue is Gln510. In the full‐length enzyme, Gln510 participates in a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network by interacting directly with Ala465 on the aldehyde anchor loop. This interaction effectively “caps” the substrate tunnel, fostering a closed conformation that maintains tetramer integrity and resists thermal denaturation. Experimental truncation of the C-terminal tail, which removes Gln510, results in an open substrate tunnel, increased exposure of hydrophilic residues, and a measurable drop in Tm (from 84 °C in the native enzyme to approximately 80 °C or lower in truncated forms). This clearly shows that Gln510 is indispensable for preserving the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Ala465 itself is another residue that is central to this stabilizing network. Its hydrogen bond with Gln510 secures the positioning of the C-terminal tail across the active site, thereby indirectly setting the stage for subsequent oligomeric interactions and thermal resistance. The loss of this bond upon truncation weakens the subunit interactions and promotes aggregation under heat stress (brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Additional residues external to the C-terminal tail also play important roles. Notably, Arg126 and Glu136 are positioned in the oligomerization domain where they form a salt bridge that is critical for maintaining intersubunit contacts. This salt bridge anchors the C-terminal extension in an orientation that reinforces the tetrameric assembly, thereby enhancing thermostability by increasing ΔG° of unfolding. Disruption of these electrostatic interactions—either by truncation or mutation—leads to a destabilization of the quaternary structure, as evidenced by both a decrease in the melting temperature and more rapid thermal aggregation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Lys105 also contributes to thermostability by packing against the negatively charged “hook” of the C-terminal tail. Its interaction prevents the tail from inappropriately folding into the interdomain cleft, a misfolding event that would otherwise compromise the structural integrity of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Furthermore, residues at the very beginning of the C-terminal extension, such as Ser503 and Gly504 (collectively termed the “Notch” region), initiate the proper trajectory of the tail. Their role is to direct the tail perpendicular to the substrate tunnel, ensuring that it adopts a conformation conducive to stabilizing the tetramer rather than interfering with catalytic access. Although these residues do not directly contribute to thermodynamic unfolding parameters, their impact on overall oligomer stability indirectly supports a higher Tm (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

Lastly, the “Crook” region (comprising Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) forms the tip of the C-terminal tail. This region is crucial not only for occluding the substrate access channel but also for creating a network of stabilizing interactions across subunits. Disruption of these residues through truncation leads not only to enhanced catalytic activity (due to better substrate accessibility) but also to compromised structural stability, reinforcing the idea that these residues are key thermostability determinants (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

In summary, the interplay between residues in the C-terminal extension (Ser503, Gly504, Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) and their interaction partners (notably Ala465, Arg126, Glu136, and Lys105) forms a robust network that enhances thermostability by maintaining the tetrameric assembly and increasing the ΔG° of unfolding, effectively raising the enzyme’s melting temperature (T_m).

This clearly shows that Gln510 is indispensable for preserving the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Ala465 itself is another residue that is central to this stabilizing network. Its hydrogen bond with Gln510 secures the positioning of the C-terminal tail across the active site, thereby indirectly setting the stage for subsequent oligomeric interactions and thermal resistance. The loss of this bond upon truncation weakens the subunit interactions and promotes aggregation under heat stress (brytan2024contributionofa pages 8-9).

Additional residues external to the C-terminal tail also play important roles. Notably, Arg126 and Glu136 are positioned in the oligomerization domain where they form a salt bridge that is critical for maintaining intersubunit contacts. This salt bridge anchors the C-terminal extension in an orientation that reinforces the tetrameric assembly, thereby enhancing thermostability by increasing ΔG° of unfolding. Disruption of these electrostatic interactions—either by truncation or mutation—leads to a destabilization of the quaternary structure, as evidenced by both a decrease in the melting temperature and more rapid thermal aggregation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Lys105 also contributes to thermostability by packing against the negatively charged “hook” of the C-terminal tail. Its interaction prevents the tail from inappropriately folding into the interdomain cleft, a misfolding event that would otherwise compromise the structural integrity of the enzyme (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Furthermore, residues at the very beginning of the C-terminal extension, such as Ser503 and Gly504 (collectively termed the “Notch” region), initiate the proper trajectory of the tail. Their role is to direct the tail perpendicular to the substrate tunnel, ensuring that it adopts a conformation conducive to stabilizing the tetramer rather than interfering with catalytic access. Although these residues do not directly contribute to thermodynamic unfolding parameters, their impact on overall oligomer stability indirectly supports a higher Tm (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

Lastly, the “Crook” region (comprising Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) forms the tip of the C-terminal tail. This region is crucial not only for occluding the substrate access channel but also for creating a network of stabilizing interactions across subunits. Disruption of these residues through truncation leads not only to enhanced catalytic activity (due to better substrate accessibility) but also to compromised structural stability, reinforcing the idea that these residues are key thermostability determinants (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11).

In summary, the interplay between residues in the C-terminal extension (Ser503, Gly504, Leu508, Ala509, and Gln510) and their interaction partners (notably Ala465, Arg126, Glu136, and Lys105) forms a robust network that enhances thermostability by maintaining the tetrameric assembly and increasing the ΔG° of unfolding, effectively raising the enzyme’s melting temperature (T_m). This integrated stabilizing mechanism is well supported by both mutational and biophysical studies (brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, brytan2024contributionofa pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8)."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase ( T. thermophilus ),6FKU,A,C295,Key catalytic residue initiating aldehyde oxidation via nucleophilic attack.,"hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The Thermus thermophilus aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDHTt) in PDB entry 6FKU chain A relies on a number of conserved residues for both its catalytic activity and its structural/biochemical regulation. Below is a detailed discussion of these residues with supporting evidence from the provided literature:

1. Cys295 – The nucleophilic cysteine in ALDHTt (equivalent to Cys302 in human ALDH2) is the key catalytic residue that initiates aldehyde oxidation by attacking the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. In its “attacking” rotamer, Cys295 forms a thiohemiacetal intermediate, a critical step in the overall five-step catalytic mechanism. Its essential role, demonstrated by mutagenesis and crystallographic studies, underscores its function as the primary nucleophile in the enzyme’s active site (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

2. Glu261 – Acting as a general base, Glu261 is positioned close to Cys295 and facilitates the deprotonation of the cysteine thiol. This activation is necessary for the catalytic cysteine to achieve its nucleophilic state, and the residue’s dynamic conformational changes upon cofactor binding (shifting between “In” and “intermediate” positions) further support its critical role. The involvement of Glu261 in hydrogen bonding with backbone elements and its repositioning during catalysis has been well characterized through crystallographic analysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9).

3. Lys182 – Integral to cofactor recruitment, Lys182 is part of the NAD(P)+ binding domain. It forms hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the adenosine ribose and phosphate groups of the cofactor, thereby positioning NAD+ correctly for hydride transfer during the oxidation reaction. This residue’s conserved role is supported by comparisons with other ALDH enzymes and direct interactions observed in crystal structures (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3).

4. Linker Residues Leu262 and Gly263 – These two residues in the linker loop contribute indirectly to catalysis by affecting the orientation of Glu261 and, by extension, the activation of Cys295. In the apo form, hydrogen bonding between Glu261 and Gly263 stabilizes a conformation that is later perturbed (by a 180° main-chain flip) upon NAD(P)+ binding. This dynamic behavior is essential for the coordination of substrate binding and catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

5. Aldehyde Anchor Loop Residues (e.g., Arg294 and Thr296) – Located near the substrate entry tunnel, these residues help coordinate binding of the product (propanoic acid) and assist in guiding the substrate into the active site. Their roles in substrate and product binding have been supported by their consistent positioning in both substrate-bound and product-bound states (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

6. NAD+ Specificity-Determining Residue Glu185 – Located near the 2′ phosphate of NADP+, Glu185 contributes to the enzyme’s cofactor preference by disfavoring NADP+ binding, thus indirectly ensuring optimal alignment of NAD+ for efficient catalysis. This biochemical rationale is supported by kinetic measurements that highlight a higher specific activity with NAD+ and structural evidence of cofactor interaction (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7).

7. C-Terminal Extension and Associated Residues (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127) – ALDHTt exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that plays a structural regulatory role by stabilizing the tetrameric quaternary structure and modulating substrate access. In particular, a salt bridge between Arg126 and Glu136, further reinforced by hydrogen bonding involving Gln510, supports the positioning of the tail over the substrate entry tunnel. Additionally, Arg127 contributes to this network by interacting with ligand molecules in the tetramer interface. These residues collectively ensure both structural integrity and proper active site accessibility, which in turn affect overall catalytic efficiency (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 9-10, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2).

In summary, the catalytic and biochemical functions of ALDHTt (PDB 6FKU chain A) critically depend on the coordinated action of residues that perform direct roles in catalysis (Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182), those that influence active site architecture and substrate binding (Leu262, Gly263, Arg294, Thr296, and Glu185), and additional residues that secure the quaternary structure and regulate substrate entry (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127). The consistency of these findings across crystallographic, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies provides compelling evidence for the essential nature of these residues in ALDHTt’s function (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, heider2025thealdehydedehydrogenase pages 3-5)."

3. Lys182 – Integral to cofactor recruitment, Lys182 is part of the NAD(P)+ binding domain. It forms hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the adenosine ribose and phosphate groups of the cofactor, thereby positioning NAD+ correctly for hydride transfer during the oxidation reaction. This residue’s conserved role is supported by comparisons with other ALDH enzymes and direct interactions observed in crystal structures (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3).

4. Linker Residues Leu262 and Gly263 – These two residues in the linker loop contribute indirectly to catalysis by affecting the orientation of Glu261 and, by extension, the activation of Cys295. In the apo form, hydrogen bonding between Glu261 and Gly263 stabilizes a conformation that is later perturbed (by a 180° main-chain flip) upon NAD(P)+ binding. This dynamic behavior is essential for the coordination of substrate binding and catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

5. Aldehyde Anchor Loop Residues (e.g., Arg294 and Thr296) – Located near the substrate entry tunnel, these residues help coordinate binding of the product (propanoic acid) and assist in guiding the substrate into the active site. Their roles in substrate and product binding have been supported by their consistent positioning in both substrate-bound and product-bound states (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

6. NAD+ Specificity-Determining Residue Glu185 – Located near the 2′ phosphate of NADP+, Glu185 contributes to the enzyme’s cofactor preference by disfavoring NADP+ binding, thus indirectly ensuring optimal alignment of NAD+ for efficient catalysis. This biochemical rationale is supported by kinetic measurements that highlight a higher specific activity with NAD+ and structural evidence of cofactor interaction (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7).

7. C-Terminal Extension and Associated Residues (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127) – ALDHTt exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that plays a structural regulatory role by stabilizing the tetrameric quaternary structure and modulating substrate access. In particular, a salt bridge between Arg126 and Glu136, further reinforced by hydrogen bonding involving Gln510, supports the positioning of the tail over the substrate entry tunnel. Additionally, Arg127 contributes to this network by interacting with ligand molecules in the tetramer interface. These residues collectively ensure both structural integrity and proper active site accessibility, which in turn affect overall catalytic efficiency (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 9-10, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2).

In summary, the catalytic and biochemical functions of ALDHTt (PDB 6FKU chain A) critically depend on the coordinated action of residues that perform direct roles in catalysis (Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182), those that influence active site architecture and substrate binding (Leu262, Gly263, Arg294, Thr296, and Glu185), and additional residues that secure the quaternary structure and regulate substrate entry (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127). The consistency of these findings across crystallographic, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies provides compelling evidence for the essential nature of these residues in ALDHTt’s function (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, heider2025thealdehydedehydrogenase pages 3-5)."

Its essential role, demonstrated by mutagenesis and crystallographic studies, underscores its function as the primary nucleophile in the enzyme’s active site (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

2. Glu261 – Acting as a general base, Glu261 is positioned close to Cys295 and facilitates the deprotonation of the cysteine thiol. This activation is necessary for the catalytic cysteine to achieve its nucleophilic state, and the residue’s dynamic conformational changes upon cofactor binding (shifting between “In” and “intermediate” positions) further support its critical role. The involvement of Glu261 in hydrogen bonding with backbone elements and its repositioning during catalysis has been well characterized through crystallographic analysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9).

3. Lys182 – Integral to cofactor recruitment, Lys182 is part of the NAD(P)+ binding domain. It forms hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the adenosine ribose and phosphate groups of the cofactor, thereby positioning NAD+ correctly for hydride transfer during the oxidation reaction. This residue’s conserved role is supported by comparisons with other ALDH enzymes and direct interactions observed in crystal structures (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3).

4. Linker Residues Leu262 and Gly263 – These two residues in the linker loop contribute indirectly to catalysis by affecting the orientation of Glu261 and, by extension, the activation of Cys295. In the apo form, hydrogen bonding between Glu261 and Gly263 stabilizes a conformation that is later perturbed (by a 180° main-chain flip) upon NAD(P)+ binding. This dynamic behavior is essential for the coordination of substrate binding and catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

5. Aldehyde Anchor Loop Residues (e.g., Arg294 and Thr296) – Located near the substrate entry tunnel, these residues help coordinate binding of the product (propanoic acid) and assist in guiding the substrate into the active site. Their roles in substrate and product binding have been supported by their consistent positioning in both substrate-bound and product-bound states (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

6. NAD+ Specificity-Determining Residue Glu185 – Located near the 2′ phosphate of NADP+, Glu185 contributes to the enzyme’s cofactor preference by disfavoring NADP+ binding, thus indirectly ensuring optimal alignment of NAD+ for efficient catalysis. This biochemical rationale is supported by kinetic measurements that highlight a higher specific activity with NAD+ and structural evidence of cofactor interaction (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7).

7. C-Terminal Extension and Associated Residues (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127) – ALDHTt exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that plays a structural regulatory role by stabilizing the tetrameric quaternary structure and modulating substrate access. In particular, a salt bridge between Arg126 and Glu136, further reinforced by hydrogen bonding involving Gln510, supports the positioning of the tail over the substrate entry tunnel. Additionally, Arg127 contributes to this network by interacting with ligand molecules in the tetramer interface. These residues collectively ensure both structural integrity and proper active site accessibility, which in turn affect overall catalytic efficiency (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 9-10, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2).

In summary, the catalytic and biochemical functions of ALDHTt (PDB 6FKU chain A) critically depend on the coordinated action of residues that perform direct roles in catalysis (Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182), those that influence active site architecture and substrate binding (Leu262, Gly263, Arg294, Thr296, and Glu185), and additional residues that secure the quaternary structure and regulate substrate entry (Arg126, Glu136, Gln510, and Arg127). The consistency of these findings across crystallographic, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies provides compelling evidence for the essential nature of these residues in ALDHTt’s function (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9, gonzalezsegura2015residuesthatinfluence pages 6-7, brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, heider2025thealdehydedehydrogenase pages 3-5)."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase ( T. thermophilus ),6FKU,A,E261,Functions as a general base activating Cys295 and undergoes conformational shifts critical for catalysis.,"hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, 3-5",literature,,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,"T. thermophilus aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDHTt) (PDB 6FKU chain A) displays several key residues whose conformational changes and interactions underpin its allosteric regulation and structural dynamics. 

First, the catalytic duo—Glu261 and Cys295—are pivotal for enzyme activity and switching between active states. Glu261 functions as a general base to activate Cys295 by abstracting a proton and displays a conformational shift from an “in” state in the apo enzyme to an “intermediate” conformation upon NAD(P)+ binding, which repositions the nicotinamide ring inside the catalytic tunnel; this repositioning is critical for hydride transfer and overall catalytic turnover (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5). Cys295, in turn, exhibits dual conformations—a catalytically active “attacking” state and a “resting” state—indicating that its spatial positioning is dynamically regulated during the catalytic cycle (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

Adjacent to these, residues Leu262 and Gly263 reside in a short linker loop that undergoes a dramatic 180° flip in its backbone orientations in response to cofactor binding; this reorientation aids in repositioning Glu261 and stabilizing cofactor interactions, embodying a clear example of conformational switching that interfaces directly with catalytic function (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5). 

Furthermore, the aldehyde anchor loop (residues 464–466) plays a regulatory role by gating substrate entry into the catalytic tunnel, and in particular, Ala465 interacts with regions of the C-terminal tail; this connection implies that the anchor loop acts in concert with distal elements to modulate substrate access and overall enzyme activity (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

A structurally unique feature of ALDHTt is its extended C-terminal tail, which is not only critical for quaternary stabilization but also implicated in allosteric regulation. The “Notch” region, consisting of Ser503 and Gly504, forms a pronounced turn that orients the tail perpendicular to the inter-domain cleft and over the substrate tunnel, thus physically influencing access to the active site (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7). Downstream, the “Crook” region—from Leu508 to Gln510—is similarly important; specifically, Gln510 forms a hydrogen bond with Ala465 of the aldehyde anchor loop, directly linking tail positioning with gate control of substrate entry (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

Additional residues within the tail further contribute to its regulatory function. Proline residues at positions Pro518, Pro521, and Pro523 enforce a rigid structure by preventing secondary structure formation, which aids in maintaining a defined conformation over the substrate entry tunnel (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8). 

At the level of quaternary structure, residues that form intersubunit networks are also central to allosteric regulation. Lys105 from the oligomerization domain packs against the negatively charged region of the tail hook, serving to lock the tail in place and restricting its flexibility (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7). In addition, the salt bridge between Arg126 and Glu136 is an evolutionarily distinct feature that links monomers through extensive hydrogen bonding; this interaction not only reinforces the tetrameric assembly but also stabilizes the tail’s position over the substrate access tunnel, thereby integrating quaternary organization with enzyme regulation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8). Finally, Arg127 participates in creating a highly positive central pore at the tetramer interface, which is thought to be involved in transmitting conformational changes between subunits and potentially impacting allosteric modulation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Collectively, the coordinated roles of Glu261 and Cys295 in catalysis, the dynamic behavior of Leu262 and Gly263, the gating function of the aldehyde anchor loop (including Ala465), the extensive regulatory contributions of the C-terminal tail (Ser503, Gly504, Leu508, Gln510, Pro518, Pro521, Pro523), and the quaternary interface residues (Lys105, Arg126, Glu136, and Arg127) provide a comprehensive picture of the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in ALDHTt (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8)."

First, the catalytic duo—Glu261 and Cys295—are pivotal for enzyme activity and switching between active states. Glu261 functions as a general base to activate Cys295 by abstracting a proton and displays a conformational shift from an “in” state in the apo enzyme to an “intermediate” conformation upon NAD(P)+ binding, which repositions the nicotinamide ring inside the catalytic tunnel; this repositioning is critical for hydride transfer and overall catalytic turnover (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5). Cys295, in turn, exhibits dual conformations—a catalytically active “attacking” state and a “resting” state—indicating that its spatial positioning is dynamically regulated during the catalytic cycle (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

Adjacent to these, residues Leu262 and Gly263 reside in a short linker loop that undergoes a dramatic 180° flip in its backbone orientations in response to cofactor binding; this reorientation aids in repositioning Glu261 and stabilizing cofactor interactions, embodying a clear example of conformational switching that interfaces directly with catalytic function (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5). 

Furthermore, the aldehyde anchor loop (residues 464–466) plays a regulatory role by gating substrate entry into the catalytic tunnel, and in particular, Ala465 interacts with regions of the C-terminal tail; this connection implies that the anchor loop acts in concert with distal elements to modulate substrate access and overall enzyme activity (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

A structurally unique feature of ALDHTt is its extended C-terminal tail, which is not only critical for quaternary stabilization but also implicated in allosteric regulation. The “Notch” region, consisting of Ser503 and Gly504, forms a pronounced turn that orients the tail perpendicular to the inter-domain cleft and over the substrate tunnel, thus physically influencing access to the active site (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7). Downstream, the “Crook” region—from Leu508 to Gln510—is similarly important; specifically, Gln510 forms a hydrogen bond with Ala465 of the aldehyde anchor loop, directly linking tail positioning with gate control of substrate entry (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

Additional residues within the tail further contribute to its regulatory function. Proline residues at positions Pro518, Pro521, and Pro523 enforce a rigid structure by preventing secondary structure formation, which aids in maintaining a defined conformation over the substrate entry tunnel (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8). 

At the level of quaternary structure, residues that form intersubunit networks are also central to allosteric regulation. Lys105 from the oligomerization domain packs against the negatively charged region of the tail hook, serving to lock the tail in place and restricting its flexibility (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

In addition, the salt bridge between Arg126 and Glu136 is an evolutionarily distinct feature that links monomers through extensive hydrogen bonding; this interaction not only reinforces the tetrameric assembly but also stabilizes the tail’s position over the substrate access tunnel, thereby integrating quaternary organization with enzyme regulation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8). Finally, Arg127 participates in creating a highly positive central pore at the tetramer interface, which is thought to be involved in transmitting conformational changes between subunits and potentially impacting allosteric modulation (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Collectively, the coordinated roles of Glu261 and Cys295 in catalysis, the dynamic behavior of Leu262 and Gly263, the gating function of the aldehyde anchor loop (including Ala465), the extensive regulatory contributions of the C-terminal tail (Ser503, Gly504, Leu508, Gln510, Pro518, Pro521, Pro523), and the quaternary interface residues (Lys105, Arg126, Glu136, and Arg127) provide a comprehensive picture of the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in ALDHTt (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8)."
Aldehyde dehydrogenase ( T. thermophilus ),6FKU,A,C295,Active-site nucleophile attacking aldehyde substrate for catalysis.,"hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5",literature,,True,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,"The structural and biochemical analyses of Thermus thermophilus aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDHTt, PDB 6FKU chain A) indicate that a number of residues in the enzyme’s catalytic and cofactor binding domains mediate substrate and ligand binding as well as specificity. The most critical of these are found in the catalytic core, the NAD(P)+ binding domain, and in the regions lining the substrate entry tunnel.

A primary set of residues comprises the catalytic triad. Cys295 is the active‐site nucleophile that, upon deprotonation, attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde substrate to form a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal intermediate. Its positioning in an “attacking” rotamer conformation is fundamental for catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). Glu261, positioned in a linker loop between the NAD(P)+ binding and catalytic domains, functions as a general base. It activates Cys295 by deprotonating it via an intervening water molecule and toggles between “In” and an intermediate state to coordinate nicotinamide binding during catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). In parallel, Lys182, which is homologous to Lys192 in human ALDH2, is implicated in stabilizing the coenzyme binding; its side chain forms hydrogen bonds with parts of the coenzyme’s adenosine moiety (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3).

Immediately adjacent to Glu261 in the linker region are Leu262 and Gly263. These residues contribute to structural stabilization of the active site by undergoing backbone conformational changes that facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions between the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme and Glu261. Gly263, in particular, forms a key hydrogen bond with Glu261, which is critical for maintaining the proper orientation of the catalytic residues during hydride transfer (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

Another critical element in substrate specificity is provided by the aldehyde anchor loop that forms at the mouth of the substrate entry channel. Within this region, Arg294 and Thr296, along with Gly464 and Ala465, are directly involved in substrate and product positioning. In product-bound structures, the carboxylate group of the acid reaction product is coordinated via hydrogen bonds with Arg294, Thr296, and Gly464 in one monomer, while in another monomer additional interactions are observed with Ala465 and Thr462 via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. These interactions are proposed to regulate substrate positioning and facilitate product release (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

The coenzyme (NAD(P)+) binding site, which is distant from the catalytic sulfur by approximately 16 Å, is lined by residues that stabilize various elements of the coenzyme. Among these, Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, and Glu404 are noted to form hydrogen bonds with the extended conformation of the coenzyme. In addition, Glu185 is particularly significant because of its proximity to the NAD(P)+ 2′ phosphate group; this spatial relationship underpins the enzyme’s observed kinetic preference for NAD+ over NADP+ (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, pages 8-9).

Finally, the enzyme exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that, while not directly part of the catalytic or binding pocket, plays a crucial structural role by interacting with N-terminal residues and several parts of the oligomerization domain. These interactions help cover and modulate the substrate access tunnel and the overall quaternary structure, indirectly influencing ligand binding and specificity (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 8-9).

In summary, the catalytic function and ligand specificity of ALDHTt (PDB 6FKU chain A) are mediated by a set of highly conserved residues. The catalytic triad—Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182—directly executes the chemical transformation, while Leu262 and Gly263 stabilize the coenzyme and active site geometry. Substrate binding is further refined by residues in the aldehyde anchor loop (Arg294, Thr296, Gly464, Ala465, and Thr462), and coenzyme binding specificity is achieved through residues including Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, Glu404, and particularly Glu185 (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3, pages 3-5, pages 8-9)."

Substrate binding is further refined by residues in the aldehyde anchor loop (Arg294, Thr296, Gly464, Ala465, and Thr462), and coenzyme binding specificity is achieved through residues including Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, Glu404, and particularly Glu185 (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3, pages 3-5, pages 8-9)."

The most critical of these are found in the catalytic core, the NAD(P)+ binding domain, and in the regions lining the substrate entry tunnel.

A primary set of residues comprises the catalytic triad. Cys295 is the active‐site nucleophile that, upon deprotonation, attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde substrate to form a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal intermediate. Its positioning in an “attacking” rotamer conformation is fundamental for catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). Glu261, positioned in a linker loop between the NAD(P)+ binding and catalytic domains, functions as a general base. It activates Cys295 by deprotonating it via an intervening water molecule and toggles between “In” and an intermediate state to coordinate nicotinamide binding during catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). In parallel, Lys182, which is homologous to Lys192 in human ALDH2, is implicated in stabilizing the coenzyme binding; its side chain forms hydrogen bonds with parts of the coenzyme’s adenosine moiety (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3).

Immediately adjacent to Glu261 in the linker region are Leu262 and Gly263. These residues contribute to structural stabilization of the active site by undergoing backbone conformational changes that facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions between the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme and Glu261. Gly263, in particular, forms a key hydrogen bond with Glu261, which is critical for maintaining the proper orientation of the catalytic residues during hydride transfer (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

Another critical element in substrate specificity is provided by the aldehyde anchor loop that forms at the mouth of the substrate entry channel. Within this region, Arg294 and Thr296, along with Gly464 and Ala465, are directly involved in substrate and product positioning. In product-bound structures, the carboxylate group of the acid reaction product is coordinated via hydrogen bonds with Arg294, Thr296, and Gly464 in one monomer, while in another monomer additional interactions are observed with Ala465 and Thr462 via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. These interactions are proposed to regulate substrate positioning and facilitate product release (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

The coenzyme (NAD(P)+) binding site, which is distant from the catalytic sulfur by approximately 16 Å, is lined by residues that stabilize various elements of the coenzyme. Among these, Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, and Glu404 are noted to form hydrogen bonds with the extended conformation of the coenzyme. In addition, Glu185 is particularly significant because of its proximity to the NAD(P)+ 2′ phosphate group; this spatial relationship underpins the enzyme’s observed kinetic preference for NAD+ over NADP+ (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, pages 8-9).

Finally, the enzyme exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that, while not directly part of the catalytic or binding pocket, plays a crucial structural role by interacting with N-terminal residues and several parts of the oligomerization domain. These interactions help cover and modulate the substrate access tunnel and the overall quaternary structure, indirectly influencing ligand binding and specificity (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 8-9).

The most critical of these are found in the catalytic core, the NAD(P)+ binding domain, and in the regions lining the substrate entry tunnel.

A primary set of residues comprises the catalytic triad. Cys295 is the active‐site nucleophile that, upon deprotonation, attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde substrate to form a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal intermediate. Its positioning in an “attacking” rotamer conformation is fundamental for catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). Glu261, positioned in a linker loop between the NAD(P)+ binding and catalytic domains, functions as a general base. It activates Cys295 by deprotonating it via an intervening water molecule and toggles between “In” and an intermediate state to coordinate nicotinamide binding during catalysis (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 3-5). In parallel, Lys182, which is homologous to Lys192 in human ALDH2, is implicated in stabilizing the coenzyme binding; its side chain forms hydrogen bonds with parts of the coenzyme’s adenosine moiety (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3).

Immediately adjacent to Glu261 in the linker region are Leu262 and Gly263. These residues contribute to structural stabilization of the active site by undergoing backbone conformational changes that facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions between the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme and Glu261. Gly263, in particular, forms a key hydrogen bond with Glu261, which is critical for maintaining the proper orientation of the catalytic residues during hydride transfer (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

Another critical element in substrate specificity is provided by the aldehyde anchor loop that forms at the mouth of the substrate entry channel. Within this region, Arg294 and Thr296, along with Gly464 and Ala465, are directly involved in substrate and product positioning. In product-bound structures, the carboxylate group of the acid reaction product is coordinated via hydrogen bonds with Arg294, Thr296, and Gly464 in one monomer, while in another monomer additional interactions are observed with Ala465 and Thr462 via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. These interactions are proposed to regulate substrate positioning and facilitate product release (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

The coenzyme (NAD(P)+) binding site, which is distant from the catalytic sulfur by approximately 16 Å, is lined by residues that stabilize various elements of the coenzyme. Among these, Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, and Glu404 are noted to form hydrogen bonds with the extended conformation of the coenzyme. In addition, Glu185 is particularly significant because of its proximity to the NAD(P)+ 2′ phosphate group; this spatial relationship underpins the enzyme’s observed kinetic preference for NAD+ over NADP+ (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 2-3, pages 8-9).

Finally, the enzyme exhibits a unique extended C-terminal arm that, while not directly part of the catalytic or binding pocket, plays a crucial structural role by interacting with N-terminal residues and several parts of the oligomerization domain. These interactions help cover and modulate the substrate access tunnel and the overall quaternary structure, indirectly influencing ligand binding and specificity (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 8-9).

In summary, the catalytic function and ligand specificity of ALDHTt (PDB 6FKU chain A) are mediated by a set of highly conserved residues. The catalytic triad—Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182—directly executes the chemical transformation, while Leu262 and Gly263 stabilize the coenzyme and active site geometry. Substrate binding is further refined by residues in the aldehyde anchor loop (Arg294, Thr296, Gly464, Ala465, and Thr462), and coenzyme binding specificity is achieved through residues including Thr156, Ser184, Arg342, Glu404, and particularly Glu185 (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, pages 2-3, pages 3-5, pages 8-9)."

1. Lys105  
K Lys105 is located in the oligomerization domain and plays a critical role in maintaining quaternary structure. It interacts electrostatically with the “hook” region of the C-terminal extension, repelling it so that the tail extends toward the N-terminus of an adjoining monomer. This arrangement is essential for imposing tetramer symmetry and overall oligomeric stability. Its conservation across homologues underlines its importance in orchestrating intersubunit interactions that prevent tail folding seen in other ALDH enzymes and thus help stabilize the functional tetramer (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

2. Gln510  
Gln510 is a key residue within the unique C-terminal tail. It forms a hydrogen bond with Ala465 from the substrate anchoring loop, effectively “locking” the substrate access tunnel in a controlled conformation. This interaction helps regulate substrate entry and contributes to both catalytic modulation and oligomerization. Mutagenesis studies in which the tail was truncated (removing Q510) resulted in enhanced substrate accessibility and catalytic efficiency, indicating that the intact Gln510-mediated interaction normally acts to restrict substrate access to fine-tune enzyme specificity. The conservation of Q510 among thermophilic ALDH homologues underpins its dual role in stabilizing the tetramer and controlling substrate gating (brytan2024contributionofa pages 2-3, brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9).

In summary, the coordinated roles of Lys105, Gln510, Ala465, the proline cluster at positions 518/521/523, and the catalytic residues Cys295, Glu261, and Lys182, together with the stabilizing salt bridge pair Arg126 and Glu136, reveal how evolutionary conservation in ALDHTt supports both its catalytic functionality and the robust structural stability necessary for thermophilic adaptation (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, 2-3; hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, 3-5, 5-7, 7-8, 8-9)."

1. Lys105  
K Lys105 is located in the oligomerization domain and plays a critical role in maintaining quaternary structure. It interacts electrostatically with the “hook” region of the C-terminal extension, repelling it so that the tail extends toward the N-terminus of an adjoining monomer. This arrangement is essential for imposing tetramer symmetry and overall oligomeric stability. Its conservation across homologues underlines its importance in orchestrating intersubunit interactions that prevent tail folding seen in other ALDH enzymes and thus help stabilize the functional tetramer (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

2. Gln510  
Gln510 is a key residue within the unique C-terminal tail. It forms a hydrogen bond with Ala465 from the substrate anchoring loop, effectively “locking” the substrate access tunnel in a controlled conformation. This interaction helps regulate substrate entry and contributes to both catalytic modulation and oligomerization. Mutagenesis studies in which the tail was truncated (removing Q510) resulted in enhanced substrate accessibility and catalytic efficiency, indicating that the intact Gln510-mediated interaction normally acts to restrict substrate access to fine-tune enzyme specificity. The conservation of Q510 among thermophilic ALDH homologues underpins its dual role in stabilizing the tetramer and controlling substrate gating (brytan2024contributionofa pages 2-3, brytan2024contributionofa pages 10-11, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 8-9).

3. Ala465  
Ala465 is part of the aldehyde anchor loop that directly interacts with Gln510. This residue is critical for maintaining the proper positioning of the active site and substrate tunnel. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between Ala465 and Gln510 provides a structural lock that prevents uncontrolled entry of substrates, which is essential for both specificity and efficient catalysis. Its involvement in these precise interactions indicates that Ala465 is highly conserved and functionally indispensable across related ALDH enzymes (brytan2024contributionofa pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

4. Pro518, Pro521, and Pro523  
Within the C-terminal extension, the prolines at positions 518, 521, and 523 serve a specific structural purpose. These proline residues impose conformational constraints that inhibit the formation of regular secondary structure elements in the area of the substrate access tunnel. By keeping this region flexible and preventing blockage, they ensure that the enzyme can maintain a balance between stability and the regulated access of substrates. Their conservation suggests that these prolines have evolved to maintain the unique gating mechanism in ALDHTt, a feature not observed in many mesophilic homologues (brytan2024contributionofa pages 2-3, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 5-7).

5. Catalytic Triad  
a. Cys295 – Serving as the nucleophile, Cys295 is the catalytic cysteine that attacks the aldehyde substrate to form a thiohemiacetal intermediate. Its positioning within the substrate tunnel (approximately 16 Å deep) and its dynamic “attacking” versus “resting” conformations are conserved features critical for catalysis, as seen in other ALDH enzymes (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

b. Glu261 – This residue functions as a general base by deprotonating Cys295, thus activating it for the nucleophilic attack. Glu261 undergoes significant conformational shifts upon cofactor binding, switching between catalytically active (“In”) and intermediate states. Its conservation emphasizes its indispensable role in driving the catalytic cycle (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2, hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 3-5).

c. Lys182 – Lys182 is involved in the stabilization of the NAD(P)+ binding site and helps mediate interactions with the cofactor. Its conservation among homologues underlines its role in cofactor positioning and overall catalytic efficiency (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 1-2).

6. Arg126 and Glu136  
These residues contribute to the stabilization of the tetrameric assembly through salt bridge formation. Arg126, in particular, is positioned near the central pore formed by the intersubunit interfaces and helps to orient the C-terminal tail relative to the rest of the enzyme. Glu136 partners with Arg126 to reinforce these intermonomer interactions. These conserved ionic interactions are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and thermostability of the enzyme (hayes2018thequaternarystructure pages 7-8).

Glutamate dehydrogenase ( T. maritima ),1B26,A,R187,Arg190 stabilizes the protein through an interdomain ion pair network.,"lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 6-7, lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 5-6",literature,R189A,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The evidence indicates that several charged residues in Glutamate dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (PDB 1B26 chain A) affect its thermostability by modulating both the melting temperature (Tm) and the free energy of unfolding (ΔG°). The most extensively characterized of these are Arg190, Glu231, and Lys193, which form a cooperative salt‐bridge triad in the NADP‐binding domain.

Arg190 is a positively charged residue that plays a significant role in stabilizing the protein through the formation of an interdomain ion pair network. In mutagenesis studies, replacing Arg190 with alanine resulted in a decrease in the free energy of unfolding by approximately 0.32 to 0.41 kcal/mol and a measurable reduction in Tm. This decrease in stability indicates that Arg190 is critical for maintaining the proper electrostatic interactions that uphold the protein’s folded state (lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 6-7, lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 5-6).

Glu231, a negatively charged residue that partners with Arg190 in the salt-bridge triad, has been shown to contribute even more substantially to thermostability. Mutational analyses in which Glu231 was substituted with alanine produced a destabilizing effect; the ΔG° decreased by up to 0.95 kcal/mol during guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation, accompanied by a corresponding drop in Tm. This pronounced effect underscores the importance of Glu231 in mediating favorable electrostatic interactions that enhance the protein’s thermal stability (lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 6-7, lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 1-2).

Lys193 is a positively charged residue that also forms part of the salt-bridge triad. In contrast to Arg190 and Glu231, mutation of Lys193 to alanine actually increased the free energy of unfolding by up to 0.98 kcal/mol and slightly raised the melting temperature. This counterintuitive stabilization suggests that, within the context of the triad, Lys193 might have a dual role. On one hand, its positive charge contributes to a network that overall favors stability through cooperative interactions with Glu231 and Arg190. On the other hand, its presence may also introduce some unfavorable charge–charge repulsion unless neutralized by binding a chloride ion, as supported by crystallographic data showing at least one chloride ion bound near Lys193 (lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 5-6, lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 9-10).

Beyond these primary residues, analyses of domain II of GDH also implicate additional charged residues such as Glu186, Arg367, Glu371, and Lys375. Although the mutagenesis studies in the cofactor binding domain focus primarily on the salt-bridge triad, recombinant domain II studies have shown that disruption of a broader network of ion pairs—including these residues—can compromise thermostability. This network is particularly evident in the intact hexameric enzyme, where interdomain interactions significantly boost the unfolding free energy compared to the isolated domain (consalvi2000thermalunfoldingand pages 5-6, consalvi2000thermalunfoldingand pages 6-7).

Overall, the cooperative interactions among Arg190, Glu231, and Lys193 play a dominant role in modulating the thermostability of GluDH from T. maritima by altering both the melting temperature and the ΔG° of unfolding. The mutagenesis and thermodynamic measurements, primarily reported by Lebbink et al., strongly support the critical involvement of these residues, while additional charged residues in domain II contribute to a broader ion pair network that further enhances stability (lebbink2002structuralandthermodynamic pages 1-2, consalvi2000thermalunfoldingand pages 5-6)."

This network is particularly evident in the intact hexameric enzyme, where interdomain interactions significantly boost the unfolding free energy compared to the isolated domain (consalvi2000thermalunfoldingand pages 5-6, consalvi2000thermalunfoldingand pages 6-7).

Overall, the cooperative interactions among Arg190, Glu231, and Lys193 play a dominant role in modulating the thermostability of GluDH from T. maritima by altering both the melting temperature and the ΔG° of unfolding.

Arg190 is a positively charged residue that plays a significant role in stabilizing the protein through the formation of an interdomain ion pair network.

Glu231, a negatively charged residue that partners with Arg190 in the salt-bridge triad, has been shown to contribute even more substantially to thermostability.

Glutamate dehydrogenase ( T. maritima ),1B26,A,K110,Essential for polarizing water molecule and forming catalytic iminoglutamate intermediate via interaction with glutamate's γ-carboxyl group.,tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) from Thermotoga maritima (PDB 1B26, chain A) has been shown by structural studies to rely on several conserved active‐site and regulatory residues for catalysis and biochemical function. For example, Asp‐154 is critical: its carboxylate group interacts electrostatically with the α–amino group of bound glutamate, and its conservation—paralleling Asp‐165 in Chlorobium symbiosum GDH—supports a role in proton abstraction during oxidative deamination (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4). Alongside Asp‐154, Lys‐114 is essential because its side‐chain amino group interacts with the γ–carboxyl group of glutamate, thereby polarizing a water molecule that promotes formation of the catalytic iminoglutamate intermediate (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4). In addition, Arg‐194 contributes by forming hydrogen bonds with the α–carboxyl group of glutamate, thereby stabilizing substrate binding within the active site (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4). 

Another functionally important residue is Lys‐102, which in T. maritima GDH forms a hydrogen bond with Asn‐350; this interaction is associated with a conformational shift from an open to a closed state that is critical for efficient catalysis (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4). Furthermore, residues involved in allosteric regulation have been identified: Asp‐166 and Arg‐134 are implicated in binding the allosteric activator leucine, with Asp‐166 interacting with the amino group and Arg‐134 with the carboxyl group of leucine, thereby modulating enzyme activity via subunit interface rearrangements (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 7-8).

Evidence from crystallographic analyses and comparative biochemistry with related hyperthermophilic and bacterial GDHs further supports the essential role of these residues. While studies of Pis‐GluDH and GDHs from Escherichia coli highlight additional conserved features in the nucleotide-binding (Rossmann) fold (including glycine‐rich motifs and specific basic residues near the coenzyme phosphate that maintain proper NAD(P)+ binding) (bhuiya2005thefirstcrystal pages 2-5, sharkey2013structureofnadp+‐dependent pages 1-2), the most directly supported key residues in the T. maritima enzyme are those involved in substrate binding, catalysis, and allosteric regulation as described above.

The structural conservation of these residues across multiple GDH homologs indicates that they are indispensable for catalytic turnover and proper enzyme conformation, with mutagenesis and kinetic studies in related systems reinforcing their critical roles in coenzyme and substrate binding as well as in maintaining quaternary structure (basith2021mappingtheintramolecular pages 14-15, goda2005intersubunitinteractioninduced pages 8-9). Thus, the essential residues in T. maritima GDH are Asp‐154, Lys‐114, Arg‐194, Lys‐102, Asp‐166, and Arg‐134, each contributing uniquely to the enzyme’s catalytic or regulatory functions through precise interactions with substrate, coenzyme, or allosteric regulators (tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 3-4, tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 7-8)."
Glutamate dehydrogenase ( T. maritima ),1B26,A,K109,Engages the α-carboxyl group of the substrate.,elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"In T. maritima GluDH (PDB 1B26, chain A), the substrate–ligand binding site is built from a set of highly conserved residues that define both the chemical specificity and the geometric architecture of the active site. Structural studies on related GluDHs, such as from Clostridium symbiosum and Mycobacterium smegmatis, strongly indicate that the following residues (or their equivalents) mediate ligand and substrate binding in T. maritima’s enzyme.

First, the recognition of the L‐glutamate γ‐carboxyl group is mediated by a lysine (K) and a serine (S). In C. symbiosum GluDH, residue K89 forms a specific ionic interaction with the γ‐carboxyl group, while S380 contributes a hydrogen bond to further refine substrate positioning. By sequence and structural homology, the T. maritima enzyme possesses equivalent residues that achieve the same recognition, ensuring that only ligands with the proper carboxylate geometry are accommodated (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155, elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 39-42).

Additionally, the substrate’s α‐carboxyl and α‐amino groups are stabilized by a combination of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. In the homolog from C. symbiosum, K113 and Q110 engage the α‐carboxyl group, whereas the α‐amino group interacts with D165 and the main chain carbonyl of G164. These interactions not only lock the substrate into position but also orient it for proper catalytic processing. T. maritima GluDH is expected to adopt this same pattern of interactions, based on the conservation of these key residues in the GluDH family (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155).

Hydrophobic contacts are also essential for substrate specificity. Residues equivalent to V377 and A163 in C. symbiosum provide a nonpolar environment that stabilizes the β- and δ-carbon atoms of the glutamate substrate through van der Waals interactions. This hydrophobic pocket is well conserved, ensuring that only the appropriate substrate fits the cleft between domains I and II (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155, elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 39-42).

A set of five glycine residues—corresponding to G90, G91, G122, G123, and G376 in the related enzyme—are critical for maintaining the flexibility and precise shape of the active site. Their small side chains allow the backbone to adopt conformations that are uniquely suited for substrate accommodation, a feature inferred by the high sequence conservation observed across species (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155).

Another pivotal residue is an arginine—R205 in C. symbiosum (paralleled by R209 in M. smegmatis, R207 in E. coli, and R211 in bovine GluDH)—which has a dual role. It shifts its position upon substrate binding to interact not only with the substrate’s carboxyl group but also forms a hydrogen bond with the nicotinamide ring of the NAD(P)+ cofactor. This repositioning is essential in both substrate recognition and in fine-tuning the enzyme’s catalytic cycle (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155, elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 207-213).

Furthermore, some studies have implicated additional residues such as Lys129 and Asp169 in the catalytic process. Although not directly binding the substrate in the classic sense, these residues participate in proton relay mechanisms that may be crucial for stabilizing intermediates during catalysis. Their roles exemplify how even residues not directly contacting the substrate can be pivotal for substrate specificity through indirect catalytic effects (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 207-213, lebbink1998engineeringactivityand pages 7-8).

Lastly, the Rossmann fold domain, which binds the NAD(P)+ cofactor, is characterized by a glycine-rich loop (GXGXXG/A). Within this region, residues such as Lys137 (located in domain I) are positioned to interact with the coenzyme, thereby linking substrate binding with cofactor orientation and subsequent hydride transfer. This further supports the notion that a finely tuned network of interactions underlies ligand specificity in GluDH (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 136-142, tomita2011structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).

Collectively, evidence from structural studies in related organisms indicates that T. maritima GluDH utilizes a conserved set of binding residues—namely those analogous to K89, S380, K113, Q110, D165, V377, A163, the glycine cluster (G90, G91, G122, G123, G376), R205, along with supportive roles for Lys129, Asp169, and Rossmann fold residues such as Lys137—to mediate precise ligand and substrate binding and specificity (elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 150-155, elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 207-213, elbrghathi2014structuralstudieson pages 39-42)."
DyP-type peroxidase ( T. fusca ),5FW4,A,R266,Key player in the catalytic mechanism; Arg315His improves H2O2 tolerance and oxidative stability.,rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 5-9; ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 37-41,literature,R314H,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,"The available excerpts do not provide clear, direct evidence that specific residues in T. fusca DyP (PDB 5FW4 chain A) have been experimentally shown to alter the melting temperature (Tm) or the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔG°). Although several studies on DyP-type peroxidases discuss residues that affect enzyme stability in general, most of the detailed thermostability investigations were performed on variants of PpDyP from Pseudomonas putida rather than on TfuDyP from T. fusca.

For example, in studies on PpDyP, residues such as H125, A142, and E188 were shown to influence loop flexibility near the heme pocket, which in turn affected both catalytic performance and thermodynamic stability (silva2022acloserlook pages 112-118, silva2022acloserlook pages 118-124). In that system, the mutation A142V was particularly implicated in decreasing thermostability due to increased loop mobility. However, no clear correspondence is made in the available TfuDyP data linking analogous residues to changes in melting temperature or ΔG°.

In the case of TfuDyP, the structural study by Rahmanpour et al. (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 5-9, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13) reports that the enzyme was subjected to site‐directed mutagenesis targeting residues D203, R315, and F336. These mutations were primarily designed to probe catalytic function. In particular, while D203 and R315 have been implicated as key players in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, the studies do not provide explicit thermodynamic data (e.g., Tm or ΔG° measurements) that attribute a change in unfolding stability directly to these residues.

Furthermore, directed evolution studies on TfuDyP, as described in the work by Ece et al. (ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 37-41, ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 76-79), identified a mutation—Arg315His—that improves H2O2 tolerance and oxidative stability. Even though this mutation is located on the distal face of the heme cofactor and is recognized as contributing to enzyme robustness under oxidative stress, the reports do not supply thermostability measurements such as a change in melting temperature or ΔG° of unfolding that would definitively implicate Arg315 (or Arg315His) as a residue affecting thermostability per se.

Insights drawn from computational studies on PpDyP underscore that residues affecting loop flexibility or those located at surface regions—where mutations can modulate electrostatic networks—play a significant role in tuning thermostability (silva2022acloserlook pages 132-137, silva2022acloserlook pages 143-150). Such findings have led to the hypothesis that similar stabilizing or destabilizing roles might be found in TfuDyP; however, due to differences in enzyme sequence and structure, no specific correspondence has been documented in the available TfuDyP literature.

In summary, while mutations in residues like D203, R315, and F336 have been studied in TfuDyP in the context of catalytic function and some aspects of stability (e.g., oxidative stability in the case of Arg315His), there is insufficient evidence in the provided context to assert that any residue in TfuDyP (PDB 5FW4 chain A) has a directly measured effect on thermostability as defined by changes in melting temperature or ΔG° of unfolding (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13, ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 37-41, silva2022acloserlook pages 112-118)."
DyP-type peroxidase ( T. fusca ),5FW4,A,R266,Distal arginine stabilizes peroxide binding and orients substrates.,rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13,literature,R314Q,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"The structure–function studies of the dye‐decolorizing peroxidase from Thermobifida fusca (TfuDyP) in pdb 5FW4 (chain A) consistently identify three key residues as essential for its catalytic and biochemical function: a proximal histidine, a distal aspartate, and a distal arginine.

The proximal histidine, which acts as the fifth ligand to the heme iron, is absolutely critical for heme binding and proper electron transfer. Multiple mutational studies have shown that substitution of the proximal histidine abolishes heme incorporation and almost completely eliminates enzymatic activity. This residue is found in a short α‐helix located between flexible loops, suggesting that it not only anchors the heme but may also contribute to the structural adaptability required for catalytic compensation in the enzyme. The evidence for the essential role of the proximal histidine comes from both mutagenesis experiments and structural analyses of TfuDyP, where its integrity is absolutely necessary to maintain the catalytic cycle of the peroxidase (chen2016bacterialdyedecolorizingperoxidases pages 7-9).

The distal aspartate, specifically Asp203 in TfuDyP, is part of the conserved GXXDG motif that is characteristic of DyP-type peroxidases. This aspartate is proposed to act as an acid–base catalyst during the formation of compound I, the high-valence intermediate crucial to peroxidase activity. Kinetic data and mutational analysis (for example, the D203A mutant) indicate that replacing this aspartate results in the complete loss of activity toward substrates such as ABTS, hydrogen peroxide, and phenolic compounds. This outcome strongly supports the role of Asp203 in proton shuttle mechanisms during peroxide activation and in stabilizing reaction intermediates (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 18-24).

The distal arginine, identified in TfuDyP as Arg315, is equally vital for catalysis. This residue is positioned on the distal heme face, where it plays a dual role: it helps to stabilize the negative charge that develops as hydrogen peroxide binds and during its cleavage, and it contributes to the proper orientation of substrates entering the active site. Mutation of Arg315 (for instance, substituting it with glutamine to produce the R315Q mutant) leads to a complete loss of detectable activity for several substrates, underscoring its essential function in substrate binding and catalytic intermediate stabilization (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13).

It is important to note that while other residues such as Phe336 are located in the vicinity of the catalytic heme and may influence substrate turnover or efficiency, mutational changes at this position (e.g., F336A) have shown that its role is modulatory rather than essential for overall enzyme activity (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 18-24). Therefore, the core catalytic mechanism in TfuDyP is centered on the coordinated action of the proximal His that bounds the heme iron, the distal Asp203 that facilitates compound I formation by acting as an acid–base catalyst, and the distal Arg315 that stabilizes peroxide binding and the ensuing transition states.

Together, these residues define a catalytic triad essential for the oxidative reactions involved in lignin degradation and other substrate oxidations catalyzed by DyPs. The consistency of these findings with related studies on other DyP-type peroxidases further substantiates the critical mechanistic roles of these amino acids (catucci2020biochemicalfeaturesof pages 16-17, shrestha2017molecularmechanismand pages 84-87, sugano2021dyptypeperoxidasesrecent pages 5-6)."
DyP-type peroxidase ( T. fusca ),5FW4,A,R266,Essential for peroxide activation and substrate oxidation.,rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The available studies on T. fusca DyP (PDB 5FW4 chain A) do not provide any direct evidence or explicit assignment of specific residues solely dedicated to allosteric regulation or conformational switching independent of their catalytic roles. In the literature, the critical residues that are highlighted—namely Asp203, Arg315, and Phe336—are examined primarily in the context of catalysis. For example, Asp203 and Arg315 are shown by mutagenesis to be essential for peroxide activation and substrate oxidation (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 13-18, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 18-24). Phe336, on the other hand, appears to modulate activity through its placement near the distal heme face, with its mutation even enhancing activity toward some substrates; these observations have been interpreted in terms of altering the active‐site cavity rather than inducing an allosteric response (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13).

There are suggestions in other studies on DyP-type peroxidases (for instance, in the work on AauDyP and KpDyP) that residues lining the heme access channels—including aromatic residues such as tyrosines and tryptophans and key aspartate/arginine pairs—could be involved in conformational rearrangements upon substrate binding or during long-range electron transfer (nys2020unravellingthestructurefunction pages 70-74, nys2020unravellingthestructurefunction pages 91-93). In addition, review articles have speculated that “swinging” movements of aspartate residues or movements of tyrosines involved in radical formation may contribute to conformational changes necessary for function (sugano2021dyptypeperoxidasesrecent pages 12-13, sugano2021dyptypeperoxidasesrecent pages 13-14). However, these insights are derived from studies on other DyP isoforms rather than T. fusca specifically.

For TfuDyP, the structural data emphasize that the enzyme features a dual-tunnel system providing access to the heme, and the narrow channel defined by the distal face (with contributions from the conserved Asp203–Arg315 pair) is central to catalytic efficiency. While conformational dynamics are inherent to the process of substrate binding and turnover—implying that minor conformational adjustments of active site residues might occur—none of the reported mutagenesis or structural studies explicitly designate these residues (or any other residue) as mediators of allosteric regulation or as switches that undergo large-scale conformational switching independent of catalysis (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 13-18).

Thus, while the structural architecture of TfuDyP (PDB 5FW4 chain A) could allow for subtle conformational or gating changes that indirectly regulate access to the heme, the literature presently supports a view that the key distal residues Asp203 and Arg315, along with Phe336, are primarily responsible for catalytic activity. No independent allosteric-regulation roles have been conclusively attributed to any residue in TfuDyP based on the available data (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13, nys2020unravellingthestructurefunction pages 70-74, sugano2021dyptypeperoxidasesrecent pages 13-14)."
DyP-type peroxidase ( T. fusca ),5FW4,A,R266,Stabilizes reaction intermediates and maintains the active site environment.,"rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 13-18, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13",literature,R314Q,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The substrate binding and specificity in Thermobifida fusca DyP-type peroxidase (PDB 5FW4 chain A) are chiefly mediated by three key residues located on the distal side of the heme pocket: Asp-203, Arg-315, and Phe-336.

Asp-203 is part of the conserved GXXDG motif and is positioned near the distal heme face where it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen ligand bound to the iron. This interaction is critical because Asp-203 is thought to act as a proton donor during hydrogen peroxide activation, likely facilitating the formation of the compound I intermediate—a key step in the peroxidase catalytic cycle. Evidence supporting its role comes from site-directed mutagenesis; substitution of Asp-203 with alanine (D203A) completely abolishes activity toward phenolic substrates and drastically reduces activity toward ABTS. These observations underscore its essential role in mediating ligand binding and proton transfer during catalysis (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 1-5, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 13-18).

Arg-315 is another residue situated in the distal heme environment. It is highly conserved among DyP enzymes and is critical for stabilizing reaction intermediates. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that replacing Arg-315 with glutamine (R315Q) eliminates activity against both phenolic substrates and ABTS. This loss of function suggests that Arg-315 is indispensable for maintaining the proper active site environment, likely by forming hydrogen bonds that stabilize the compound I intermediate, which in turn ensures efficient substrate oxidation (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 13-18, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13).

Phe-336, while not absolutely essential for catalysis, plays a modulatory role in substrate binding specificity. The aromatic side chain of Phe-336 is located near the entrance of the substrate access tunnel. Its presence appears to influence the size and shape of the substrate binding pocket. Notably, mutation of Phe-336 to alanine (F336A) results in an enhancement of activity toward ABTS oxidation, possibly by enlarging the active site cavity and reducing steric hindrance for incoming substrates. This finding supports a role for Phe-336 in fine-tuning the selectivity and binding efficiency for substrates (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 18-24, silva2022acloserlook pages 108-112).

In addition to these residues, the heme iron itself is coordinated by a proximal histidine, His-299. Although His-299’s primary function is to secure heme binding, its role is critical because the correct positioning of the heme cofactor is required to maintain the spatial arrangement of Asp-203, Arg-315, and Phe-336, and thus indirectly influences substrate specificity by ensuring the active site has the requisite architecture (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13).

Furthermore, the crystal structure reveals that two molecular tunnels provide access to the heme cofactor. The larger tunnel, which is lined by Asp-203, Arg-315, and Phe-336 among other residues, directs substrates and the hydrogen peroxide co-substrate into the enzyme’s active site. Molecular docking studies suggest that additional interactions, including potential hydrogen bonding to a heme propionate side chain, may assist in ligand orientation, thereby further refining substrate specificity (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13, silva2022acloserlook pages 37-42).

Overall, the convergence of crystallographic data, mutagenesis experiments, and kinetic assays provides strong evidence that Asp-203, Arg-315, and Phe-336 are the key residues that mediate ligand and substrate binding and specificity in T. fusca DyP peroxidase. Their precise roles—from proton donation and intermediate stabilization (Asp-203 and Arg-315) to modulation of the active site cavity (Phe-336)—ensure that substrates are optimally positioned for efficient oxidation (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 1-5, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 13-18, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifusa pages 9-13)."
DyP-type peroxidase ( T. fusca ),5FW4,A,R266,Stabilizes compound I intermediate and interacts with substrates or H2O2.,"ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 76-79, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 1-5",literature,R314H;R314Q,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The highly conserved residues in TfuDyP (T. fusca DyP-type peroxidase, PDB 5FW4 chain A) that are linked to the enzyme’s structural stability and catalytic function include Asp203, Arg315, His299, and Phe336.

Asp203 is located on the distal heme side and serves as a critical proton donor during catalysis. Its position enables it to participate directly in the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thereby facilitating the generation of the reactive compound I intermediate. Mutagenesis of Asp203 (for example, the D203A mutant) results in a complete loss of activity toward phenolic substrates, underscoring its indispensable role in catalysis and supporting its strong evolutionary conservation among DyP homologues (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 1-5, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 18-24).

Arg315 is another key conserved residue positioned on the distal face of the heme pocket. Its charged nature is critical for stabilizing the compound I intermediate and possibly for interacting with substrates or H2O2 during the catalytic cycle. Mutation studies, where Arg315 was replaced by histidine or glutamine (R315His or R315Q), show a significant decrease or complete loss of activity, which indicates that Arg315 is essential for maintaining the correct heme environment and overall enzymatic stability, particularly under conditions of high H2O2 concentration (ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 76-79, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 1-5).

His299 functions as the proximal axial ligand that coordinates the heme iron. This interaction is paramount for preserving the redox properties of the heme cofactor and ensuring the proper orientation of the iron within the catalytic pocket. The consistent presence and conservation of His299 across DyP peroxidases indicate its critical structural role in forming the active site and facilitating efficient electron transfer during substrate oxidation (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13).

Phe336 is positioned approximately 3.6 Å above the distal face of the heme porphyrin and contributes to shaping the topology of the heme pocket. While mutation of Phe336 (to Ala) does not abolish activity and can even enhance it in some cases, its presence seems to modulate substrate binding and accessibility. The conserved nature of this residue and its location suggest it plays a modulatory role that fine-tunes the active site architecture, which may indirectly affect overall catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity (rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 18-24, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13).

Collectively, these residues—Asp203, Arg315, His299, and Phe336—form the core elements of the catalytic machinery of TfuDyP. Asp203 and Arg315, residing in the distal heme pocket, are directly involved in activating hydrogen peroxide and stabilizing reaction intermediates, while His299 on the proximal side is essential for heme iron coordination and maintenance of the enzyme’s redox state. Phe336, though less critical than the others, plays an important role in defining the substrate access pathway and the structural environment of the active site. Their conservation across DyP-type peroxidases is supported by extensive mutagenesis studies, crystallographic data, and comparative analysis of homologous enzymes, establishing them as key determinants of both stability and function (ece2018heterologousexpressionof pages 76-79, habib2019characterizationofa pages 1-3, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 1-5, rahmanpour2016structureofthermobifida pages 9-13)."
Lactate dehydrogenase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1LDN,A,T245,"Crucial for modulating active site loop movement, governing substrate access to catalytic site.",ikehara2014thecoreof pages 15-15,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The key catalytic and regulatory residues identified in Geobacillus stearothermophilus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (PDB 1LDN chain A) are His195, Asp168, Arg171, Arg109, and Thr246. Each of these residues has been demonstrated by structural and biochemical studies to play specific roles essential for the enzyme’s function.

His195 is central to catalysis as it functions in proton transfer reactions. Structural analyses reveal that His195 acts as the acid/base catalyst during the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. It forms a catalytic pair with Asp168, stabilizing both the ground state and the transition state during the hydride transfer from NADH to pyruvate. The pivotal role of His195 in catalysis is supported by both crystallographic studies and biochemical assays, highlighting its involvement in proper substrate alignment and activation (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 6-7).

Asp168 partners with His195 by providing complementary charge and hydrogen bonding that facilitate the proton shuttle mechanism. This catalytic pairing stabilizes substrate orientation in the active site and ensures efficient catalytic turnover. The cooperative function of Asp168 with His195 is a recurrent theme in LDH enzymes and is reinforced by comparative studies with analogous enzymes, emphasizing its role in substrate activation and transition state stabilization (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 6-7).

Arg171 is another essential residue that contributes primarily to substrate binding and allosteric transitions. It is involved in direct interactions with the substrate as well as with other subunits by forming salt bridges or hydrogen bonding networks. Notably, Arg171 undergoes orientation changes between the inactive T (tense) state and the active R (relaxed) state; in the T state, its side chain extends away from the active site, thereby impacting substrate binding. These conformational shifts underline the role of Arg171 in both catalytic activity and regulation of the enzyme’s allosteric equilibrium (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 6-7).

Arg109, while playing a less prominent role in substrate binding than the other residues, is nevertheless essential in forming part of the network of interactions necessary for optimal positioning of the substrate during the hydrogen transfer step. Its contributions, though more modest, help to stabilize the substrate in the active site and maintain the overall electrostatic environment necessary for catalysis (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 6-7).

Thr246 is implicated in the dynamic movements of the active site loop. Structural evidence indicates that Thr246 is crucial for modulating loop movement, which in turn governs substrate access to the catalytic site. Although not directly contributing to substrate binding, mutations at this residue have been shown to impede the conformational transitions required for efficient catalysis, underscoring its importance in the enzyme’s kinetic properties (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 15-15).

Together, these residues form an interdependent network that contributes not only to the chemical conversion of substrates but also to the enzyme’s intricate regulatory mechanisms. Their roles have been corroborated by multiple structural studies and comparative analyses in bacterial LDHs, thus establishing an evolutionarily conserved framework for catalysis and regulation in these enzymes (piontek1990structuredeterminationand pages 14-16, ikehara2014thecoreof pages 6-7)."

First, residue Q203 is critical; its position at the dimer–dimer interface implicates it in the regulation of FBP (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) activation. In mutagenesis experiments, the mutation Q203L in a triple mutant was shown to produce an enzyme that remains active in the absence of FBP, highlighting its role in the allosteric mechanism by altering FBP responsiveness (sagdic2015q102randq203l pages 22-28).

Another important residue is Q102. When Q102 is mutated to arginine (Q102R), the enzyme undergoes a conformational switch that changes its substrate specificity from lactate/pyruvate to oxaloacetate/malate. This observation indicates that Q102 not only contributes to substrate binding but also influences large-scale conformational rearrangements that underpin the enzyme’s regulatory behavior (sagdic2015q102randq203l pages 22-28).

Arg171 is another critical residue in the LDH allosteric network. In a wide range of bacterial LDHs, including related enzymes where its homologous counterpart (Arg173 in Thermus caldophilus LDH) has been studied extensively, Arg171 has been shown to reorient between the T (tense) and R (relaxed) states. In the T state-like conformation of GsLDH, Arg171 is oriented away from the active site, leading to reduced catalytic activity and a higher substrate Km, thereby emphasizing its role in controlling the enzyme’s activity through its spatial positioning (taguchi2017thesimpleand pages 27-29).

Closely linked to Arg171 is Glu178, a residue that stabilizes the T state conformation. Glu178 achieves this by forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with Arg171, mitigating the electrostatic repulsions that are characteristic of the positively charged clusters at subunit interfaces. Consequently, Glu178 is critical in fine-tuning the balance between the allosteric states through intersubunit interactions (ikehara2014thecoreof pages 13-14).

Arg216 is also involved in allosteric regulation. It participates in forming a cluster of positively charged residues at the subunit interfaces, contributing to static electrostatic repulsions that modulate conformational equilibrium between tetrameric and dimeric forms. Alterations at or around Arg216 affect the stability of the tetramer and, by extension, the enzyme’s overall activity and response to allosteric activators (taguchi2017thesimpleand pages 23-25).

Finally, Thr246 is highlighted as a catalytic residue that is essential for the enzyme’s reaction but not directly for substrate binding. Its involvement in conformational rearrangements suggests that the position and movement of Thr246 contribute to the dynamic switching between active and inactive states, making it an important element in the allosteric regulation mechanism despite its primary role in catalysis (taguchi2017thesimpleand pages 29-29, ikehara2014thecoreof pages 15-15).

Collectively, these residues—Q203, Q102, Arg171, Glu178, Arg216, and Thr246—form an integrated network that couples local structural changes at the active site and intersubunit interfaces to global conformational transitions. The interplay of these amino acids supports a mechanism whereby FBP binding, electrostatic interactions, and mutational effects combine to control the delicate equilibrium between the enzyme’s active and inactive states (sagdic2015q102randq203l pages 22-28, ikehara2014thecoreof pages 2-4, taguchi2017thesimpleand pages 27-29)."

Lactate dehydrogenase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1LDN,A,T245,Shapes active site dimensions; T246G mutation expands pocket for bulkier substrates.,binay2013adoublemutant pages 5-5,literature,T245G,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB 1LDN chain A) utilizes a network of active‐site residues to correctly bind its substrate (lactate/pyruvate) and coenzyme and to impose stereospecificity. Detailed structural, mutagenesis, and kinetic studies have firmly established roles for several key residues:

1. Arginine 171  
Arginine 171 is critical for binding the substrate’s carboxylate group. Its guanidinium side chain forms a bifurcated salt bridge with the carboxyl group, thereby stabilizing the substrate within the active site. Structural studies and substrate analog complex crystallography have consistently demonstrated that mutation of Arg171 dramatically reduces binding affinity and catalytic efficiency, confirming its central role in orienting the substrate for hydride transfer during catalysis (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4, dafforn1997correlationofthe pages 1-2).

2. Arginine 109  
Arginine 109, located in a mobile loop region, plays a multifaceted role in substrate binding. Upon substrate binding, the side chain of Arg109 undergoes a large movement (approximately 23 Å) toward the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme, thereby helping to secure the substrate in an orientation that favors efficient hydride transfer. Chemical modification studies indicate that Arg109 is essential both for stabilizing negative charges developing during transition states and for mediating loop closure necessary to generate a catalytic conformation (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4, binay2013adoublemutant pages 5-6).

3. Arginine 101  
Arginine 101 contributes to coenzyme binding by interacting with the pyrophosphate groups of NADH. Its repositioning during loop collapse aids in the proper encapsulation of the coenzyme’s adenine moiety, ensuring the correct alignment of the nicotinamide ring for catalysis. Structural evidence underlines that the movement of Arg101 is a prerequisite for active site formation (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 1-2).

4. Histidine 195  
His195 is positioned in close proximity to the substrate and acts as a proton donor/acceptor during the catalytic reaction. By shuttling protons at the appropriate stage of catalysis, His195 ensures stereospecific hydride transfer from the substrate’s methyl group directly to the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. Its critical role in substrate orientation and catalysis is supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments that drastically reduce activity upon substitution (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4, binay2013adoublemutant pages 4-5).

5. Glutamine 102  
Gln102 contributes to fine-tuning substrate specificity. Mutagenesis studies, including the Q102R mutation, have shown that alterations at this position can shift the enzyme’s substrate preference, highlighting its involvement in establishing precise hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions with the substrate. This role in specificity is bolstered by comparative analyses that indicate its conservation and function in ligand recognition (sagdic2015q102randq203l pages 22-28, nishiya2019malatedehydrogenaseof pages 9-9).

6. Threonine 246 and Isoleucine 240  
These two residues shape the physical dimensions of the active site. T246, located near a tight turn adjacent to the mobile coenzyme loop, participates in hydrogen bonding with substrate carboxyl groups. Its bulky side chain limits active-site volume, thereby imposing selectivity for pyruvate relative to larger analogs. Conversely, I240, when present alongside T246, further constrains the steric environment. Mutations to smaller residues (e.g., T246G and I240A) have been shown to expand the pocket, allowing the accommodation of bulkier substrates (such as l-mandelate) at the expense of catalytic efficiency with native substrates (binay2013adoublemutant pages 5-5, binay2013adoublemutant pages 5-6).

7. Aspartate 168  
Asp168 helps maintain the proper charge distribution within the active site. It is proposed to balance the positive charge of His195 during catalysis, contributing to the stabilization of transition states and ensuring optimal substrate positioning. Its involvement is inferred from biochemical studies that correlate mutations at this position with significant decreases in activity (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4, dafforn1997correlationofthe pages 1-2).

8. Glutamate 140  
This residue forms stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the nicotinamide ribose. Its interaction is believed to protect the positive charge on the oxidized coenzyme while also collaborating with other residues (such as Arg109) to maintain electrostatic balance during catalysis. Such interactions are essential for the precise positioning of the coenzyme in the active site (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4).

In summary, the interplay among Arg171, Arg109, Arg101, His195, Gln102, T246, I240, Asp168, and Glu140 orchestrates both ligand binding and substrate specificity in G. stearothermophilus LDH, as supported by a wealth of structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis data (adams1973structurefunctionrelationshipsin pages 2-4, binay2013adoublemutant pages 5-6, sagdic2015q102randq203l pages 22-28, piontek1990structuredeterminationand pages 18-18)."

Asp168 and Arg171 play direct roles in substrate binding and positioning, while His195 is critical for the pH‐dependent catalytic mechanism. These three residues are strictly conserved across MalDHs and LDHs and are central to the catalytic process, as repeatedly demonstrated by crystallographic and biochemical studies (Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 14-15, Uchikoba2002crystalstructureof pages 5-6, Colletier2012samplingtheconformational pages 1-2).

In summary, the highly conserved catalytic triad of Asp168, Arg171, and His195 forms the core of LDH’s enzymatic function (Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 14-15, Uchikoba2002crystalstructureof pages 5-6). Surrounding these, the residues A30, M41, K131, Q233, and A259 have been shown to modulate enzyme kinetics, substrate interaction, and thermal stability (Chen2024exploringthekey pages 6-9).

Collectively, these groups of residues are consistently conserved across LDH homologues and represent the critical determinants of both catalytic function and structural stabilization in G. stearothermophilus LDH."
Lactate dehydrogenase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1LDN,A,K43,"Participates in intersubunit ionic interactions, essential for structural stability.",Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 7-9,literature,,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"The literature converges on several groups of residues in the G. stearothermophilus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) structure (PDB 1LDN chain A) that are both highly conserved across homologues and linked intimately to catalytic function, substrate binding, and structural stability.

First, multiple studies identify the active‐site residues that are indispensable for catalysis. The most prominent of these are Asp168, Arg171, and His195. Asp168 and Arg171 play direct roles in substrate binding and positioning, while His195 is critical for the pH‐dependent catalytic mechanism. These three residues are strictly conserved across MalDHs and LDHs and are central to the catalytic process, as repeatedly demonstrated by crystallographic and biochemical studies (Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 14-15, Uchikoba2002crystalstructureof pages 5-6, Colletier2012samplingtheconformational pages 1-2).

Second, mutational analysis specifically conducted on the residues surrounding the active center—namely, Ala30 (A30), Met41 (M41), Lys131 (K131), Gln233 (Q233), and Ala259 (A259)—provides clear evidence that these positions, although not direct catalytic residues, are critical for fine-tuning enzymatic behavior. For instance, the M41G mutation shifts the optimal pH for the reverse reaction to 10, suggesting that M41 contributes to environmental adaptability and influences enzyme function; K131, when mutated, forms additional hydrogen bonds with the substrate and alters its spatial proximity to the active site, which hints at a role in substrate interaction and catalytic efficiency; and A30, Q233, and A259 affect thermal stability, with some mutations increasing the initial unfolding temperature by up to 13°C and A259I specifically reducing stability (Chen2024exploringthekey pages 6-9).

Third, several studies underscore the importance of residues at the intersubunit interfaces that construct stabilizing ionic networks, which are essential for maintaining the quaternary structure of the enzyme. In the case of LDHs from various species, residues such as Lys43 (K43), Asp44 (D44), Asp256 (D256), Glu259 (E259), Lys263 (K263), and Arg267 (R267) participate in key ionic interactions. These intersubunit contacts are conserved and strongly linked to structural stability, and similar networks are implied to exist in G. stearothermophilus LDH, helping to maintain its tetrameric assembly under varying thermal conditions (Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 7-9).

Fourth, additional residues implicated in allosteric regulation and dynamic conformational shifts include His188, which undergoes a pronounced side-chain rotation upon effector binding, and further supports stabilization in both active and inactive states (Colletier2012samplingtheconformational pages 7-8, Ikehara2014thecoreof pages 14-15).

In summary, the highly conserved catalytic triad of Asp168, Arg171, and His195 forms the core of LDH’s enzymatic function (Coquelle2007activitystabilityand pages 14-15, Uchikoba2002crystalstructureof pages 5-6).

Cellulase Cel124 ( Clostridium thermocellum ),2XQO,A,N48,Supports catalysis by stabilizing substrate or catalytic residues.,bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3,literature,N187A,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"Glu96 is the primary catalytic residue in CtCel124 and is essential for its endoglucanase activity. Structural studies show that Glu96 is positioned at the C‐terminus of the central helix, where it donates a proton to the glycosidic oxygen during bond cleavage. Mutation of Glu96 to alanine (E96A) completely abolishes activity against a range of polysaccharide substrates that have poor leaving groups, establishing its critical role as a catalytic acid. The local environment—comprising hydrophobic and polar contributions from neighboring residues such as Tyr203, Tyr187, Leu119, and Gln117—modulates its pKa to about 6.8, ensuring it remains protonated under physiological conditions and thus functionally active (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).

Ser110 is another residue that plays a significant role in the biochemical function of Cel124. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments, where Ser110 was substituted by alanine, glutamate, or aspartate, revealed alterations in the kinetic parameters during the hydrolysis of cellohexaose. These observations suggest that S110 is important for proper substrate binding and/or catalytic turnover, possibly by influencing the positioning of the substrate in the active site during catalysis (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).

Asn188 has also been identified as playing a supportive role in catalysis. Although it is not the primary acid/base catalyst, mutation of Asn188 to alanine leads to a reduction in activity, indicating that N188 is likely involved in stabilizing the substrate or proper positioning of other catalytic residues in the active site (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).

In addition to these residues, the crystal structure of Cel124 reveals that the active site is a coordinated ensemble of several amino acids that work together to mediate substrate recognition and transition state stabilization. Gln117, Tyr187, and Tyr203 are part of the catalytic core that makes direct polar interactions with cellotriose molecules bound in the substrate-binding cleft. Their positioning suggests they play roles in substrate anchoring and might contribute to the orientation of the glycosidic bond for efficient cleavage. Although these residues are not modified in mutagenesis experiments as stringently as Glu96, their conservation and spatial alignment support functional roles in both substrate specificity and the stabilization of the transition state during catalysis (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).

Thus, the essential residues for the catalytic or biochemical function of Cellulase Cel124 (CtCel124) in PDB 2XQO chain A can be summarized as follows:
• Glu96 acts as the catalytic acid critical for proton donation during glycosidic bond cleavage.
• Ser110 is important for substrate binding and catalytic efficiency, as evidenced by altered kinetics upon mutation.
• Asn188 contributes to substrate positioning and proper active site architecture.
• Gln117, Tyr187, and Tyr203, while not directly catalytic, form part of the structural framework that enables efficient substrate interaction and transition state stabilization.

Each of these residues contributes to the unique catalytic mechanism and biochemical function of CtCel124, as supported by biochemical assays and detailed structural analyses documented in the literature (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5)."
Cellulase Cel124 ( Clostridium thermocellum ),2XQO,A,N48,Involved in substrate binding and catalysis; mutations affect activity.,bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4; zhang2015sitedirectedmutagenesisof pages 14-14,literature,N187A,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"Based on the available contextual evidence, no residue in Cellulase Cel124 (Clostridium thermocellum, PDB 2XQO chain A) has been demonstrated to participate in allosteric regulation or conformational switching. The primary structural and mutagenesis studies on this enzyme have focused on mapping the catalytic center and substrate interactions rather than identifying remote regulatory or dynamic “allosteric” sites.

For example, the crystallographic study by Brás et al. (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4) thoroughly characterizes the unique α8 superhelical fold and details the active site composition. Within the active site, residues such as Glu96, which functions as the catalytic acid, as well as other residues like Gln117, Tyr187, Asn188, and Tyr203, have been highlighted for their roles in substrate binding and catalysis. Similarly, mutagenesis experiments (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, zhang2015sitedirectedmutagenesisof pages 14-14) have shown that substitutions such as E96A, S110 mutants, and N188A affect catalytic activity and kinetics. However, none of these residues have been identified or implicated as being involved in allosteric regulation or governing conformational switching.

Furthermore, the contextual evidence from both crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies does not provide any indication that methodologies designed to map allosteric networks—such as network analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, or NMR spectroscopy—were applied to CtCel124. The description in Brás et al. (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 6-6) and subsequent literature (zhang2015sitedirectedmutagenesisof pages 12-14) is exclusively centered on catalytic mechanisms and substrate binding. No references or experimental evidence indicate that any residue outside of the active site or its immediate surroundings acts as an allosteric “switch” in this enzyme.

In addition, while comprehensive reviews on protein allostery (guo2016proteinallosteryand pages 22-24, guo2016proteinallosteryand pages 3-5) provide robust frameworks and computational strategies for identifying residue networks mediating allosteric regulation in other systems, these methods have not been applied to Cellulase Cel124 as per the provided context. Similarly, the study by Stetz and Verkhivker (stetz2016probingallostericinhibition pages 17-20) outlines advanced approaches for mapping allosteric processes in chaperone proteins but does not extend any findings or residue contributions to cellulases.

In summary, while the enzyme exhibits a set of critical residues that fundamentally underpin its catalytic activity (e.g., Glu96, S110, Asn188), there is no evidence from the crystallographic, mutagenesis, or computational studies cited that any residue in Cellulase Cel124 (PDB 2XQO chain A) contributes to allosteric regulation or conformational switching. Consequently, based on the current published literature and experimental data provided in the context, no residue has been defined as participating in allostery in this particular cellulase (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, zhang2015sitedirectedmutagenesisof pages 14-14, guo2016proteinallosteryand pages 22-24)."
Cellulase Cel124 ( Clostridium thermocellum ),2XQO,A,N48,Interacts with cellotriose moiety to stabilize substrate orientation.,bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4,literature,,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"The high‐resolution crystal structure of CtCel124 (PDB ID 2XQO, chain A) clearly delineates a substrate‐binding cleft that is finely tuned to engage cellulose fragments, with distinct subsites accommodating cellotriose ligands in both twisted and linear conformations. The key residues in this cleft contribute either directly to catalysis or through specific polar and hydrophobic interactions that mediate ligand recognition and substrate specificity.

First and foremost, Glu96 is the critical catalytic acid. This residue is positioned at the C‐terminus of the central helix and lies directly beneath the β face of the +1 glucose unit. Its side chain is ideally oriented to donate a proton to the scissile glycosidic oxygen, facilitating bond cleavage. The importance of Glu96 is underscored by mutagenesis experiments; for example, substitution with alanine (E96A) results in a complete loss of catalytic activity on substrates that require protonation for hydrolysis (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).

Within the binding cleft, several residues make direct polar contacts with the glucosyl units. Backbone carbonyls and amides from Glu96, Asn126, Thr187, and Thr189 establish a network of hydrogen bonds that not only help to secure the ligand but also define the precise geometry of the substrate‐binding subsites (–4 to –2 on one side and +1 to +3 on the other). These interactions are critical for maintaining the integrity of the binding site and ensuring that the substrate is positioned optimally for catalysis (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4).

Gln117, although not directly hydrogen bonding with the ligand, contributes indirectly by modulating the microenvironment of the active site. Its aliphatic side chain helps form an apolar region around Glu96, which adjusts the pKa of the catalytic acid residue, thereby confirming its necessity for an efficient catalytic process (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).

Other residues, notably Tyr187, Asn188, and Tyr203, further refine substrate binding and specificity. Tyr187 and Asn188 appear to interact directly with the cellotriose moiety, probably through a combination of stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions; these interactions help to lock the substrate in a defined orientation within the pocket. Tyr203 not only helps form direct polar contacts with the ligand but also contributes to the stabilization of the active site environment by influencing the protonatable state of Glu96 (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5).

Met131 also plays a supportive role in substrate binding. Although its contribution may be subtler than direct catalytic residue interactions, its backbone involvement in hydrogen bonding serves to further stabilize the ligand within the cleft (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4).

Collectively, these residues—Glu96, Asn126, Thr187, Thr189, Gln117, Tyr187, Asn188, Tyr203, and Met131—define multiple subsites within the binding cleft. This organization not only supports specific ligand binding but also explains the enzyme’s preference for substrates that mimic the structure of cellulose at the interface between crystalline and amorphous regions (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6).

In summary, the evidence shows that ligand and substrate binding specificity in CtCel124 is mediated primarily by:  
• Glu96 acting as the catalytic acid (essential for proton donation and catalysis),  
• Asn126, Thr187, and Thr189 forming a hydrogen-bond network with the substrate,  
• Gln117 contributing to defining the active site’s electrostatic environment, and  
• Tyr187, Asn188, Tyr203, and Met131 forming additional polar and hydrophobic contacts that stabilize the bound ligand.  

These conclusions are primarily supported by high-resolution crystallographic data and mutagenesis studies outlined in the corresponding research (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 5-6)."
Cellulase Cel124 ( Clostridium thermocellum ),2XQO,A,N48,Important for substrate binding and maintaining active site geometry.,"bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4",literature,N187A,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"The crystallographic and mutagenesis data on the GH124 family enzyme Cel124 from Clostridium thermocellum (PDB 2XQO chain A) identify several residues whose conservation across homologues links them both to catalysis and to maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme’s active site.

One of the most critical residues is Glu96. Structural studies and site‐directed mutagenesis have firmly established that Glu96 functions as the catalytic acid. It is positioned at the C‐terminus of the central helix, where it forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 atom of the glucose residing at the +1 subsite. This positioning is essential for proton donation during glycosidic bond cleavage, and mutation of Glu96 to alanine (E96A) results in complete loss of activity against substrates like β‐glucan. The critical function of Glu96 is bolstered by its interactions with nearby residues (such as Tyr203 and hydrophobic contributors like Leu119), which help to maintain its protonated state and, by extension, the integrity of the catalytic pocket (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).

Another set of highly conserved residues involved directly in substrate recognition and stabilization are Gln117, Tyr187, and Tyr203. Gln117 is thought to contribute to the local electrostatic environment surrounding Glu96, effectively modulating its pKa and ensuring optimal activity. Structural overlays with homologous copies in related families, such as the GH23 enzymes, demonstrate that Gln117’s position is critical for substrate contact and stabilization. Similarly, Tyr187 and Tyr203 lie at the heart of the active site cleft and make direct polar or hydrophobic contacts with cello-oligosaccharide substrates. Their conservation across homologous enzymes suggests that they are indispensable for precise substrate positioning and for maintaining the proper orientation of the catalytic acid during the reaction (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4).

In addition to these residues, Asn188 is also highly conserved among homologues. Its role in the enzyme is inferred from mutagenesis studies where replacement with alanine (N188A) led to reduced kinetic parameters on substrates such as cellohexaose. This reduction indicates that Asn188 is important for substrate binding – perhaps through direct hydrogen bonding or by maintaining the geometry of the active site – and thereby indirectly contributes to both enzymatic function and structural stability (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4).

Finally, while not as essential as Glu96, residue Ser110 is notably conserved, and mutations at this position (to alanine, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid) resulted in enzymes that retained activity but exhibited altered kinetic behavior. This suggests that Ser110 plays a modulatory role in tuning the active site’s microenvironment and may be involved in subtle adjustments of the substrate-binding pocket, thereby contributing to overall catalytic efficiency and maintaining local stability of the enzyme structure (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).

Together, these residues—Glu96 as the key catalytic acid, supported by Gln117, Tyr187, Tyr203, and Asn188 in substrate binding and active site structuring, plus the modulatory influence of Ser110—form a network of interactions that are highly conserved across Cel124 homologues. Their conservation emphasizes not only their roles in ensuring effective catalysis (through precise substrate binding and transition state stabilization) but also in maintaining the characteristic superhelical fold that underpins the enzyme’s structural stability. The integrated evidence from biochemical mutagenesis studies and detailed crystallographic analyses firmly links these residues to the dual purposes of catalytic function and structural integrity (bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 3-4, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 4-5, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-1, bras2011structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)."

1. His-95 and His-96 – These two histidine residues are shown to be involved in forming a hydrogen bond network with the substrate. They interact with the C1–C3 hydroxyl groups of the (1)-glucose unit and are proposed to play an essential role in substrate stabilization during catalysis. Their importance is supported by structural analyses and mutagenesis data demonstrating that altering these residues significantly compromises enzyme activity (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

2. Asn-135 and Glu-136 – Both residues contribute to the active site’s architecture by mediating hydrogen bonds with the substrate. Glu-136, in particular, is located in a position consistent with the typical acidic residue in family 5 glycoside hydrolases involved in the double-displacement mechanism. The glutamate is likely to function either as a proton donor or in stabilizing the reaction intermediate. Asn-135 helps to adjust the precise geometry of the binding pocket. Their roles are inferred from crystallographic data that shows direct interaction with substrate hydroxyl groups along with mutagenesis experiments that have documented changes in the kinetic parameters upon substitution (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

3. Tyr-198 – Tyr-198 is critical for substrate binding as it forms a hydrogen bond with (1)-glucose. The side chain of this tyrosine is optimally oriented to interact with the sugar, thereby contributing to substrate specificity. Comparative structural studies have revealed that its positioning is distinct relative to similar enzymes from other organisms, reinforcing the idea that Tyr-198 is a key determinant in mediating substrate recognition (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

4. His-277 – This residue has been implicated as essential for mannanase activity. Although TmCel5A displays multifunctional behavior (exhibiting cellulase and xylanase activities as well), His-277 appears particularly critical for the mannanase function. Mutational analysis in homologous enzymes demonstrates that substitution at this position leads to a severe reduction or loss of mannanase activity, even though the effects on cellulase or xylanase functions are less pronounced. This differential impact underscores its role in modulating substrate specificity (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

There is also a mention in comparative work that additional residues such as His-205 and Trp-210 might contribute to the substrate binding and catalytic function. In related structures (e.g., CtCel5E) the corresponding residues are positioned differently, and the absence of a Trp-210 equivalent in those enzymes correlates with the loss of mannanase activity. This evidence further emphasizes that the precise arrangement of amino acids in and around the catalytic cleft, including those already detailed, is essential for fine-tuning enzymatic specificity and activity (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6, telke2013engineeringoffamily5 pages 10-11).

Glu-136, in particular, is located in a position consistent with the typical acidic residue in family 5 glycoside hydrolases involved in the double-displacement mechanism. The glutamate is likely to function either as a proton donor or in stabilizing the reaction intermediate. Asn-135 helps to adjust the precise geometry of the binding pocket. Their roles are inferred from crystallographic data that shows direct interaction with substrate hydroxyl groups along with mutagenesis experiments that have documented changes in the kinetic parameters upon substitution (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

3. Tyr-198 – Tyr-198 is critical for substrate binding as it forms a hydrogen bond with (1)-glucose. The side chain of this tyrosine is optimally oriented to interact with the sugar, thereby contributing to substrate specificity. Comparative structural studies have revealed that its positioning is distinct relative to similar enzymes from other organisms, reinforcing the idea that Tyr-198 is a key determinant in mediating substrate recognition (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

4. His-277 – This residue has been implicated as essential for mannanase activity. Although TmCel5A displays multifunctional behavior (exhibiting cellulase and xylanase activities as well), His-277 appears particularly critical for the mannanase function. Mutational analysis in homologous enzymes demonstrates that substitution at this position leads to a severe reduction or loss of mannanase activity, even though the effects on cellulase or xylanase functions are less pronounced. This differential impact underscores its role in modulating substrate specificity (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

There is also a mention in comparative work that additional residues such as His-205 and Trp-210 might contribute to the substrate binding and catalytic function. In related structures (e.g., CtCel5E) the corresponding residues are positioned differently, and the absence of a Trp-210 equivalent in those enzymes correlates with the loss of mannanase activity. This evidence further emphasizes that the precise arrangement of amino acids in and around the catalytic cleft, including those already detailed, is essential for fine-tuning enzymatic specificity and activity (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6, telke2013engineeringoffamily5 pages 10-11).

Overall, the combined structural, mutagenesis, and comparative analyses consistently identify His-95, His-96, Asn-135, Glu-136, Tyr-198, and His-277 as critical for the catalytic and biochemical function of TmCel5A (PDB 3AMC chain A) (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6)."

Endoglucanase Cel5A ( Thermotoga maritima ),3AMC,A,E133,Catalytic nucleophile for hydrolysis.,barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"Endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima (PDB 3AMC chain A) is a glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) enzyme whose substrate recognition and specificity derive from a combination of conserved catalytic and aromatic residues that collectively define the active‐site architecture. Below is a detailed discussion of each key residue implicated in ligand binding and how the available experimental and structural evidence supports its role.

First, the catalytic machinery is defined by two glutamates: one acting as the nucleophile and the other as the proton donor. Specifically, Glu136 is positioned to perform the nucleophilic attack during hydrolysis, while Glu253 (equivalent to E253 in Tm_EG referenced by Barruetabeña et al.) functions as the proton donor, thereby orchestrating the two-step retaining double-displacement mechanism typical of GH5 enzymes (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8).

Next, key aromatic residues lining the substrate-binding cleft are instrumental for ligand stabilization via stacking interactions. In particular, Trp210 is recurrently mentioned as forming a long conformational loop that “clamps” the substrate into a catalytically favorable orientation. This tryptophan provides π-stacking interactions with sugar rings, significantly enhancing substrate retention under thermophilic conditions (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8, ye2022synergicactionof pages 8-9). In addition, two more tryptophan residues, Trp174 and Trp258, have been identified as critical contributors to forming the substrate’s hydrophobic binding environment. Their aromatic side chains aid in stacking interactions that align the β-1,4-glucan chain optimally within the active-site groove (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8).

Beyond these central stacking interactions, additional residues involved in more specific hydrogen bond formation with substrate hydroxyl groups further determine specificity. For instance, Tyr198 has been shown in comparative biochemical analyses to form hydrogen bonds with specific sugar hydroxyls, notably engaging the C1-OH or C5-O of a (–1)-glucose or (–1)-mannose moiety, thereby refining substrate discrimination (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 8-9). Similarly, His205 contributes to ligand binding by forming hydrogen bonds with the C6-OH of adjacent sugar units. These interactions are crucial in mediating mannanase activity in enzymes like TmCel5A, and their presence in the substrate optical network suggests a dual role in recognizing both cello- and manno-configurations (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

Additional residues further ensure proper substrate orientation. Binding studies have implicated the involvement of His95, His96, and Asn135 in forming a hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes the sugar moiety as it enters the binding cleft. Although these residues are not as prominently featured as the aromatic clamp residues, their conserved nature within the (β/α)_8 TIM-barrel fold and documented hydrogen bond interactions underscore a supportive role in substrate positioning (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

These structural observations are corroborated by extensive mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation studies that reveal marked decreases in catalytic efficiency when any of these residues are altered. The overall picture that emerges is one in which catalytic glutamates (E136 and E253) provide the chemical drive for hydrolysis, while the aromatic residues (notably Trp210, Trp174, and Trp258) along with Tyr198 and His205 define the precise substrate binding and specificity profile required for efficient cellulose turnover in a high-temperature environment (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8, ye2022synergicactionof pages 8-9, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

In summary, Endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima relies on a conserved catalytic dyad (Glu136 and Glu253) coupled with a network of aromatic residues (Trp210, Trp174, Trp258) and supporting binding residues (Tyr198, His205, His95, His96, Asn135) to achieve precise ligand binding and substrate specificity under thermophilic conditions. This integrated molecular arrangement is well supported by crystallographic, mutagenesis, and computational studies as detailed in the referenced literature (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8, ye2022synergicactionof pages 8-9, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6)."

Below is a detailed discussion of each key residue implicated in ligand binding and how the available experimental and structural evidence supports its role.

First, the catalytic machinery is defined by two glutamates: one acting as the nucleophile and the other as the proton donor. Specifically, Glu136 is positioned to perform the nucleophilic attack during hydrolysis, while Glu253 (equivalent to E253 in Tm_EG referenced by Barruetabeña et al.) functions as the proton donor, thereby orchestrating the two-step retaining double-displacement mechanism typical of GH5 enzymes (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8).

Next, key aromatic residues lining the substrate-binding cleft are instrumental for ligand stabilization via stacking interactions. In particular, Trp210 is recurrently mentioned as forming a long conformational loop that “clamps” the substrate into a catalytically favorable orientation. This tryptophan provides π-stacking interactions with sugar rings, significantly enhancing substrate retention under thermophilic conditions (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8, ye2022synergicactionof pages 8-9). In addition, two more tryptophan residues, Trp174 and Trp258, have been identified as critical contributors to forming the substrate’s hydrophobic binding environment. Their aromatic side chains aid in stacking interactions that align the β-1,4-glucan chain optimally within the active-site groove (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8).

Beyond these central stacking interactions, additional residues involved in more specific hydrogen bond formation with substrate hydroxyl groups further determine specificity. For instance, Tyr198 has been shown in comparative biochemical analyses to form hydrogen bonds with specific sugar hydroxyls, notably engaging the C1-OH or C5-O of a (–1)-glucose or (–1)-mannose moiety, thereby refining substrate discrimination (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 8-9). Similarly, His205 contributes to ligand binding by forming hydrogen bonds with the C6-OH of adjacent sugar units. These interactions are crucial in mediating mannanase activity in enzymes like TmCel5A, and their presence in the substrate optical network suggests a dual role in recognizing both cello- and manno-configurations (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

Additional residues further ensure proper substrate orientation. Binding studies have implicated the involvement of His95, His96, and Asn135 in forming a hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes the sugar moiety as it enters the binding cleft. Although these residues are not as prominently featured as the aromatic clamp residues, their conserved nature within the (β/α)_8 TIM-barrel fold and documented hydrogen bond interactions underscore a supportive role in substrate positioning (yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 6-8).

These structural observations are corroborated by extensive mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation studies that reveal marked decreases in catalytic efficiency when any of these residues are altered. The overall picture that emerges is one in which catalytic glutamates (E136 and E253) provide the chemical drive for hydrolysis, while the aromatic residues (notably Trp210, Trp174, and Trp258) along with Tyr198 and His205 define the precise substrate binding and specificity profile required for efficient cellulose turnover in a high-temperature environment (barruetabena2019resurrectionofefficient pages 7-8, ye2022synergicactionof pages 8-9, yuan2015biochemicalcharacterizationand pages 5-6).

In summary, Endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima relies on a conserved catalytic dyad (Glu136 and Glu253) coupled with a network of aromatic residues (Trp210, Trp174, Trp258) and supporting binding residues (Tyr198, His205, His95, His96, Asn135) to achieve precise ligand binding and substrate specificity under thermophilic conditions.

In the study by Almeida et al. (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 6-8), the authors deliberately substituted these residues with alanine in two mutant forms—T1 (W12A and I217A) and T2 (all four mutations: W12A, H195A, I217A, F404A)—with the aim of perturbing the noncovalent interactions between the two (β/α)4 half-barrels of the enzyme.

W12 and I217 are located in key β-strands that contribute significantly to the inter-half contacts. W12, positioned in β-strand 1, and I217, positioned in β-strand 5, establish stabilizing interactions at the interface between the two (β/α)4 subdomains. Their substitution with alanine is theorized to disrupt essential hydrophobic and possibly π-stacking interactions, leading to a diminished structural integrity of the overall (β/α)8 barrel. The experimental evidence showed that although the T1 mutant (with only W12A and I217A) retained a thermostability profile similar to the wild-type, these residues are nonetheless critical in establishing the interface that underpins proper folding and stability under high thermal stress (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 3-6).

H195 and F404, on the other hand, are situated in regions outside the barrel core—likely within or near external α-helices—and contribute to quaternary interactions that connect the two barrel halves. Histidine 195 may be involved in hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions that help organize the relative positioning of structural elements. Phenylalanine 404, being an aromatic residue, is likely to contribute to stabilizing the structure via hydrophobic and π interactions. In the T2 mutant, which includes the removal of these additional interactions, the melting temperature (Tm) was clearly decreased, and enzyme inactivation was observed at elevated temperatures (75 and 80°C). This directly implicates the role of H195 and F404 in enhancing the free energy barrier (ΔG° of unfolding) that protects against thermally induced denaturation (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 8-11).

The collective data suggest that these four residues act cooperatively. Disrupting inter-half contacts by mutating W12 and I217 alone does not abolish thermostability entirely—implying that the enzyme structure has inherent robustness in its (β/α)8 fold—but the cumulative effect of adding the H195A and F404A mutations (as in mutant T2) significantly compromises the protein’s ability to maintain its native state at high temperatures. This observation is supported by changes in CD spectral profiles and activity assays, which together indicate that these inter-half contacts are essential for maintaining a high melting temperature and elevated ΔG° of unfolding (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 14-15).

Thus, the experimental evidence from Thermotoga maritima β‐glucosidase demonstrates that W12, I217, H195, and F404 are critical residues governing the thermostability of this enzyme, with their respective contributions to hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions acting in concert to stabilize the (β/α)8 barrel architecture under extreme thermal conditions (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 6-8, almeida2018searchforindependent pages 8-11)."

In the T2 mutant, which includes the removal of these additional interactions, the melting temperature (Tm) was clearly decreased, and enzyme inactivation was observed at elevated temperatures (75 and 80°C). This directly implicates the role of H195 and F404 in enhancing the free energy barrier (ΔG° of unfolding) that protects against thermally induced denaturation (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 8-11).

The collective data suggest that these four residues act cooperatively. Disrupting inter-half contacts by mutating W12 and I217 alone does not abolish thermostability entirely—implying that the enzyme structure has inherent robustness in its (β/α)8 fold—but the cumulative effect of adding the H195A and F404A mutations (as in mutant T2) significantly compromises the protein’s ability to maintain its native state at high temperatures. This observation is supported by changes in CD spectral profiles and activity assays, which together indicate that these inter-half contacts are essential for maintaining a high melting temperature and elevated ΔG° of unfolding (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 14-15).

Thus, the experimental evidence from Thermotoga maritima β‐glucosidase demonstrates that W12, I217, H195, and F404 are critical residues governing the thermostability of this enzyme, with their respective contributions to hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions acting in concert to stabilize the (β/α)8 barrel architecture under extreme thermal conditions (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 6-8, almeida2018searchforindependent pages 8-11)."
β-Glucosidase ( Thermotoga maritima ),1OD0,A,F394,Stabilizes structure via hydrophobic and π interactions in quaternary contacts.,almeida2018searchforindependent pages 8-11,literature,F403A,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The principal residues reported to affect thermostability in Thermotoga maritima β‐glucosidase (PDB 1OD0, chain A) are tryptophan 12 (W12), isoleucine 217 (I217), histidine 195 (H195), and phenylalanine 404 (F404). In the study by Almeida et al. (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 6-8), the authors deliberately substituted these residues with alanine in two mutant forms—T1 (W12A and I217A) and T2 (all four mutations: W12A, H195A, I217A, F404A)—with the aim of perturbing the noncovalent interactions between the two (β/α)4 half-barrels of the enzyme.

W12 and I217 are located in key β-strands that contribute significantly to the inter-half contacts. W12, positioned in β-strand 1, and I217, positioned in β-strand 5, establish stabilizing interactions at the interface between the two (β/α)4 subdomains. Their substitution with alanine is theorized to disrupt essential hydrophobic and possibly π-stacking interactions, leading to a diminished structural integrity of the overall (β/α)8 barrel. The experimental evidence showed that although the T1 mutant (with only W12A and I217A) retained a thermostability profile similar to the wild-type, these residues are nonetheless critical in establishing the interface that underpins proper folding and stability under high thermal stress (almeida2018searchforindependent pages 3-6).

H195 and F404, on the other hand, are situated in regions outside the barrel core—likely within or near external α-helices—and contribute to quaternary interactions that connect the two barrel halves. Histidine 195 may be involved in hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions that help organize the relative positioning of structural elements. Phenylalanine 404, being an aromatic residue, is likely to contribute to stabilizing the structure via hydrophobic and π interactions. In the T2 mutant, which includes the removal of these additional interactions, the melting temperature (Tm) was clearly decreased, and enzyme inactivation was observed at elevated temperatures (75 and 80°C).

In this enzyme these are Glu166 and Glu351. Glu166 acts as the general acid/base, donating a proton to the leaving group and later abstracting a proton to activate water for the hydrolytic step. Glu351 serves as the nucleophile, forming a transient covalent glycosyl–enzyme intermediate during the double‐displacement (retaining) mechanism. This assignment is supported by crystallographic inhibitor–complex studies showing that inhibitors designed to mimic the transition state bind in configurations where their hydroxyl or heteroatom groups are positioned within hydrogen‑bonding distance of these two critical residues (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 1-2, gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Beyond the catalytic glutamates, additional residues in the active site play a vital role in substrate recognition and stabilization. For instance, Glu405 is reported to participate in hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl groups of bound inhibitors, suggesting that it helps to correctly orient the substrate for catalysis (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8). Similarly, a network of residues—including Gln20, Trp398, and Trp406—forms critical interactions with substrates, ensuring that the enzyme adopts the proper conformation for effective hydrolysis. Other residues such as His121, Asn165, and Tyr295 also contribute to the active site architecture by establishing hydrogen bonds that stabilize both substrate and transition-state analogs (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Computational docking studies further strengthen the evidence that these residues are essential. Analyses of ligand binding energies and geometric proximity criteria (maintaining distances <3.0 Å between key ligand atoms and the catalytic residues) have consistently identified the catalytic glutamates alongside nearby structural residues as critical for substrate binding and proper enzymatic function. For example, statistical models in the docking experiments clearly highlight the importance of maintaining intact interactions at the positions corresponding to the acid/base and nucleophilic glutamates (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 85-87, hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 171-176). Furthermore, complementary computational approaches emphasize that the retention of a nearby conserved tryptophan—in analogous enzymes it is a key structural contributor—supports the stabilization of the substrate’s glycon portion (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 89-93).

In addition to the residues directly participating in catalysis and substrate binding, structural stability is an essential component of biochemical function. Domain analysis and mutagenesis studies in Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase indicate that residues outside the immediate active site also contribute significantly. For instance, mutations of hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan at position 12 (W12), isoleucine at position 217 (I217), phenylalanine at position 404 (F404), and the charged residue histidine at position 195 (H195) have been shown to compromise the overall stability of the enzyme.

In this enzyme these are Glu166 and Glu351. Glu166 acts as the general acid/base, donating a proton to the leaving group and later abstracting a proton to activate water for the hydrolytic step. Glu351 serves as the nucleophile, forming a transient covalent glycosyl–enzyme intermediate during the double‐displacement (retaining) mechanism. This assignment is supported by crystallographic inhibitor–complex studies showing that inhibitors designed to mimic the transition state bind in configurations where their hydroxyl or heteroatom groups are positioned within hydrogen‑bonding distance of these two critical residues (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 1-2, gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Beyond the catalytic glutamates, additional residues in the active site play a vital role in substrate recognition and stabilization. For instance, Glu405 is reported to participate in hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl groups of bound inhibitors, suggesting that it helps to correctly orient the substrate for catalysis (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8). Similarly, a network of residues—including Gln20, Trp398, and Trp406—forms critical interactions with substrates, ensuring that the enzyme adopts the proper conformation for effective hydrolysis. Other residues such as His121, Asn165, and Tyr295 also contribute to the active site architecture by establishing hydrogen bonds that stabilize both substrate and transition-state analogs (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Computational docking studies further strengthen the evidence that these residues are essential. Analyses of ligand binding energies and geometric proximity criteria (maintaining distances <3.0 Å between key ligand atoms and the catalytic residues) have consistently identified the catalytic glutamates alongside nearby structural residues as critical for substrate binding and proper enzymatic function. For example, statistical models in the docking experiments clearly highlight the importance of maintaining intact interactions at the positions corresponding to the acid/base and nucleophilic glutamates (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 85-87, hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 171-176). Furthermore, complementary computational approaches emphasize that the retention of a nearby conserved tryptophan—in analogous enzymes it is a key structural contributor—supports the stabilization of the substrate’s glycon portion (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 89-93).

In addition to the residues directly participating in catalysis and substrate binding, structural stability is an essential component of biochemical function. Domain analysis and mutagenesis studies in Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase indicate that residues outside the immediate active site also contribute significantly. For instance, mutations of hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan at position 12 (W12), isoleucine at position 217 (I217), phenylalanine at position 404 (F404), and the charged residue histidine at position 195 (H195) have been shown to compromise the overall stability of the enzyme. Although these residues do not directly participate in the chemical steps of catalysis, their role in maintaining the proper folding and stability of the (β/α)8 barrel is crucial for ensuring that the active site is correctly assembled and functional (almeida2016identificaçãodedomínios pages 71-76).

In summary, the essential catalytic or biochemical functions of T. maritima β‑glucosidase (PDB 1OD0 chain A) are predominantly attributed to:

Instead, evidence is inferred by analogy to studies of related GH1 family enzymes and through computational analyses such as molecular dynamics, residue network (protein structure network) analyses, coevolution studies, and RMSF fluctuations.

One source (manna2021molecularinsightinto pages 2-4) describes detailed residue interaction network analyses for an Agrobacterium tumefaciens β‑glucosidase (PDB 6RJK) exhibiting a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold. In that study, residues lining the active site and substrate tunnel—including N170, C174, N297, W405, L178, H185, N227, Y299, H126, W127, W413, and T300—were found to participate in conformational dynamics; additional residues within flexible loop regions (W40, W173, W177, V225, F250, H251, M302, and T358) were noted to fluctuate at higher glucose concentrations, suggesting roles in switching between conformations. Because Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase shares significant structural similarity with these GH1 enzymes, analogous residues in its structure may mediate similar allosteric or conformational changes (manna2021molecularinsightinto pages 2-4).

In parallel, the Glutantβase database work (mariano2020glutantβaseadatabase pages 5-7 and pages 9-11) emphasizes that coevolution network analyses and comparative structural modeling identify key substrate channel residues and mobile loops (especially in loops B and C) as candidates for regulating glucose tolerance and dynamic switching. Although these studies do not name specific residue numbers for Thermotoga maritima, they support the concept that residues within flexible loop regions and at the substrate channel are critical. This means that the equivalent positions in the T. maritima enzyme might participate in long‐range interactions that govern both catalytic efficiency and allosteric regulation.

Additional evidence comes from engineering studies on Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase reported by Ouyang et al. (ouyang2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11). In that work, mutations such as N222F, Y295F, and F414S were introduced to alter the active center environment, improving hexyl‑β‑glycoside productivity. Although these mutations were aimed at modulating substrate binding rather than demonstrating classical allosteric control, their location in the enzyme’s structure suggests that residues N222, Y295, and F414 could also influence conformational switching dynamics, given the typical involvement of active site pockets in allosteric transitions.

Finally, insights from studies of TIM barrel dynamics (kursula2003crystallographicstudieson pages 30-34, pages 68-70) reveal that loop motions—especially those analogous to TIM’s loop 6 with its hinge residues (e.g. Pro168, Val169, Trp170, etc.)—are key to switching between open and closed states. By analogy, mobile loops in T. maritima β‑glucosidase are likely to contain corresponding residues that modulate active site accessibility and contribute to allosteric regulation.

In summary, while no publication in the provided context offers definitive residue-level characterization for Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase (PDB 1OD0 chain A), the collective evidence suggests that candidate residues include those lining the substrate tunnel and active site (analogous to N170, C174, N297, etc.), loop residues (analogous to W40, W173, W177, V225, F250, H251, M302, T358), and mutation‐targeted residues (N222, Y295, F414) that have been implicated in modulating substrate access and dynamics in related GH1 enzymes (manna2021molecularinsightinto pages 2-4, mariano2020glutantβaseadatabase pages 5-7, ouyang2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, kursula2003crystallographicstudieson pages 30-34).

β-Glucosidase ( Thermotoga maritima ),1OD0,A,E341,Catalytic nucleophile attacking the anomeric carbon during catalysis.,gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The structural and biochemical evidence for ligand binding and substrate specificity in Thermotoga maritima β‑glucosidase (PDB 1OD0, chain A) centers on a network of conserved residues that both perform catalysis and directly interact with substrate hydroxyl groups.

First, the two essential catalytic glutamates have been clearly identified. Glu351 functions as the nucleophile that attacks the anomeric carbon of the glycoside during catalysis, whereas Glu166 acts as the acid/base catalyst to donate or abstract a proton during substrate turnover. In studies using glucoimidazole inhibitors—which mimic the transition‐state geometry—both Glu351 and Glu166 have been shown to tightly interact with inhibitors. Compounds with heteroatoms at the anomeric position establish hydrogen bonds with these residues, emphasizing their dual role in catalysis and in defining ligand binding geometry (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Beyond catalysis, additional residues modulate binding specificity via hydrogen bond networks and polar interactions. Glu405 is positioned to engage specifically with hydroxyl groups on the substrate. The C6 hydroxyl group of inhibitors has been observed to interact directly with Glu405, and the C4 hydroxyl can also contact Glu405 along with water-mediated networks. This dual interaction likely imposes the stereochemical constraints required to discriminate between sugar moieties (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Another set of residues that contribute to substrate positioning are primarily within the hydrogen bond network surrounding the sugar’s C3 hydroxyl. Gln20, Trp398, Trp406, and His121 have been found to form hydrogen bonds with the C3 hydroxyl group of bound inhibitors. These interactions reinforce the correct orientation of the ligand within the active site and sharpen substrate specificity by ensuring precise alignment of the sugar moiety with respect to the catalytic residues (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Additional specificity is provided by Asn165, which plays a role when inhibitors or substrates bear a C2 hydroxyl or carbonyl group. This residue interacts in concert with Glu351 to enhance active site recognition; thus, it helps the enzyme to distinguish between closely related carbohydrate substrates (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Tyr295 is another residue noted to participate when the sugar substrate incorporates a modification such as a heteroatom replacing the endocyclic oxygen. In such cases, Tyr295 forms hydrogen bonds either directly or via a water‐mediated network, thereby stabilizing the altered ligand within the active site (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Complementary computational studies on GH1 enzymes have suggested that analogous active‐site residues (for example, aromatic residues playing roles similar to those found in Zea mays β‑glucosidase, where a conserved tryptophan is important) are critical for modulating glycon specificity. Although the precise mapping may vary with residue numbering, these studies support the idea that in T. maritima β‑glucosidase, similar interactions—hydrogen bonding supplemented by hydrophobic or π‐stacking contacts—further refine substrate selectivity (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 80-85, hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 89-93).

In summary, the active site of T. maritima β‑glucosidase (PDB 1OD0 chain A) employs an integrated network of residues that mediate ligand binding and specificity. The catalytic residues Glu351 (nucleophile) and Glu166 (acid/base) orchestrate the chemical transformation, while Glu405, Gln20, Trp398, Trp406, His121, Asn165, and Tyr295 form a precise set of interactions with the sugar substrate.

In such cases, Tyr295 forms hydrogen bonds either directly or via a water‐mediated network, thereby stabilizing the altered ligand within the active site (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Complementary computational studies on GH1 enzymes have suggested that analogous active‐site residues (for example, aromatic residues playing roles similar to those found in Zea mays β‑glucosidase, where a conserved tryptophan is important) are critical for modulating glycon specificity. Although the precise mapping may vary with residue numbering, these studies support the idea that in T. maritima β‑glucosidase, similar interactions—hydrogen bonding supplemented by hydrophobic or π‐stacking contacts—further refine substrate selectivity (hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 80-85, hill2008computationalanalysisof pages 89-93).

In summary, the active site of T. maritima β‑glucosidase (PDB 1OD0 chain A) employs an integrated network of residues that mediate ligand binding and specificity. The catalytic residues Glu351 (nucleophile) and Glu166 (acid/base) orchestrate the chemical transformation, while Glu405, Gln20, Trp398, Trp406, His121, Asn165, and Tyr295 form a precise set of interactions with the sugar substrate.

First, the two essential catalytic glutamates have been clearly identified. Glu351 functions as the nucleophile that attacks the anomeric carbon of the glycoside during catalysis, whereas Glu166 acts as the acid/base catalyst to donate or abstract a proton during substrate turnover.

These interactions reinforce the correct orientation of the ligand within the active site and sharpen substrate specificity by ensuring precise alignment of the sugar moiety with respect to the catalytic residues (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 7-8).

Additional specificity is provided by Asn165, which plays a role when inhibitors or substrates bear a C2 hydroxyl or carbonyl group.

First, the catalytic apparatus is defined by two highly conserved glutamate residues. Glu166 functions as the acid/base catalyst, donating a proton to the leaving group during glycoside hydrolysis and later activating a water molecule for hydrolysis of the glycosyl–enzyme intermediate. Its precise ionization state governs the reaction’s pH dependence and, hence, its catalytic efficiency. In parallel, Glu351 acts as the nucleophile, forming a transient covalent intermediate with the substrate before being resolved by water attack. Together, these residues form the basis of a double‐displacement mechanism characteristic of family GH1 glycosidases. Multiple high‐resolution crystallographic inhibitor complex studies have confirmed not only their spatial proximity in the active site but also their indispensable chemical roles in both catalysis and transition state stabilization (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 1-2, gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 3-4).

Second, residues located at the inter‐domain interface within the (β/α)8 TIM barrel are crucial for maintaining the enzyme’s cooperative folding and structural integrity. In Almeida’s mutagenesis studies, key hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan 12 (W12), isoleucine 217 (I217), and phenylalanine 404 (F404) were targeted along with a charged residue, histidine 195 (H195). Although TmGH1 naturally folds as a single TIM barrel, these residues are part of an interfacial network that appears to be evolved from a putative (β/α)4 duplication event. Substitutions at these positions (as in the T1 and T2 mutants) led to detectable decreases in thermal stability and altered secondary structure content. In particular, the data indicate that the integrity of the hydrophobic core, augmented by these side chains, is fundamental to the enzyme’s stability across different denaturation conditions (almeida2016identificaçãodedomínios pages 71-76).

Third, although not explicitly detailed in the structure of TmGH1, comparative structural studies with homologous β‐glucosidases (for example, in BglM-G1) reveal that a residue corresponding to position 75 is frequently involved in an inter-residue salt bridge with a catalytic glutamate. In BglM-G1, the wild-type enzyme contains His75, which in its variant (H75R) forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the catalytic nucleophile (analogous to Glu351/352). This salt bridge has been correlated with enhanced thermal stability via reduced atomic mobility at the substrate binding site. While this particular observation comes from studies on BglM-G1, the conservation of such a residue in the homologous region suggests that a similar mechanism could contribute to the stability-function balance in TmGH1 (mhaindarkar2018lossofa pages 7-8).

In addition, residues peripheral to the active site—specifically W12, I217, F404, and H195—help secure the integrity of the TIM barrel fold by stabilizing the interface between its two halves. Finally, residues analogous to position 75, known from homologous enzymes, are also implicated in modulating the delicate balance between catalytic turnover and enzyme stability through salt bridge formation. Together, these conserved residues underpin both the robust catalytic performance and the notable thermostability characteristic of TmGH1 (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 1-2, gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 3-4, almeida2016identificaçãodedomínios pages 71-76, mhaindarkar2018lossofa pages 7-8)."

First, the catalytic apparatus is defined by two highly conserved glutamate residues. Glu166 functions as the acid/base catalyst, donating a proton to the leaving group during glycoside hydrolysis and later activating a water molecule for hydrolysis of the glycosyl–enzyme intermediate. Its precise ionization state governs the reaction’s pH dependence and, hence, its catalytic efficiency. In parallel, Glu351 acts as the nucleophile, forming a transient covalent intermediate with the substrate before being resolved by water attack. Together, these residues form the basis of a double‐displacement mechanism characteristic of family GH1 glycosidases. Multiple high‐resolution crystallographic inhibitor complex studies have confirmed not only their spatial proximity in the active site but also their indispensable chemical roles in both catalysis and transition state stabilization (gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 1-2, gloster2007glycosidaseinhibitionan pages 3-4).

Second, residues located at the inter‐domain interface within the (β/α)8 TIM barrel are crucial for maintaining the enzyme’s cooperative folding and structural integrity. In Almeida’s mutagenesis studies, key hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan 12 (W12), isoleucine 217 (I217), and phenylalanine 404 (F404) were targeted along with a charged residue, histidine 195 (H195). Although TmGH1 naturally folds as a single TIM barrel, these residues are part of an interfacial network that appears to be evolved from a putative (β/α)4 duplication event. Substitutions at these positions (as in the T1 and T2 mutants) led to detectable decreases in thermal stability and altered secondary structure content. In particular, the data indicate that the integrity of the hydrophobic core, augmented by these side chains, is fundamental to the enzyme’s stability across different denaturation conditions (almeida2016identificaçãodedomínios pages 71-76).

Third, although not explicitly detailed in the structure of TmGH1, comparative structural studies with homologous β‐glucosidases (for example, in BglM-G1) reveal that a residue corresponding to position 75 is frequently involved in an inter-residue salt bridge with a catalytic glutamate. In BglM-G1, the wild-type enzyme contains His75, which in its variant (H75R) forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the catalytic nucleophile (analogous to Glu351/352). This salt bridge has been correlated with enhanced thermal stability via reduced atomic mobility at the substrate binding site. While this particular observation comes from studies on BglM-G1, the conservation of such a residue in the homologous region suggests that a similar mechanism could contribute to the stability-function balance in TmGH1 (mhaindarkar2018lossofa pages 7-8).

Xylanase ( Thermomyces lanuginosus ),1YNA,A,R116,"Forms a salt bridge with Asp93, contributing to structural stability.",vucinic2021acomparativestudy pages 16-18,literature,,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"In Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase (PDB 1YNA chain A), several residues have been identified as highly conserved among GH11 homologues and are directly linked to catalytic function and structural stability.

First, the two catalytic glutamates—Glu77 and Glu170—are indispensable for the enzyme’s retaining mechanism of xylan hydrolysis. Glu77 functions as the nucleophile/base while Glu170 acts as a proton donor during catalysis. Their conservation across homologues underscores their central roles in substrate turnover, with detailed structural analysis and sequence comparisons confirming their importance (briganti2021structuralandmolecular pages 4-6, dey2018putativeroleof pages 4-5).

In addition to the catalytic glutamates, specific aromatic residues at key substrate binding subsites are also highly conserved. Notably, Tyr87 and Tyr172 are located at the +2 and +3 subsites of the active site. These tyrosines participate in stabilizing interactions with the substrate’s positive or sugar moieties, as evidenced by drastic reductions (up to 95% activity loss) when mutated in related enzymes. Their conservation and critical role in substrate orientation underline their dual contribution to both catalytic function and enzyme stability (briganti2021structuralandmolecular pages 4-6, ramakumar2018roleoflongrange pages 12-15).

Aromatic residues also contribute significantly to long-range interactions that reinforce the overall fold. In thermophilic GH11 xylanases, including Thermomyces lanuginosus, an additional aromatic clique composed of residues such as Tyr77, Tyr78, and Trp138 has been identified. This cluster forms long-range interactions that link distant regions of the molecule, thereby enhancing structural rigidity under thermal stress. The presence of this aromatic cluster in the thermophilic enzyme, as opposed to its mesophilic homologues where equivalent positions are occupied by non‐aromatic residues, provides strong evidence for its role in thermostability (ramakumar2018roleoflongrange pages 12-15, ramakumar2018roleoflongrange pages 5-8).

Beyond direct catalytic and aromatic interactions, several residues are implicated in maintaining a network of invariant water molecules that are critical for the enzyme’s structural integrity. In particular, residues such as H144 and R145 in chain A form stable hydrogen-bonding networks with conserved water molecules (e.g., IW3 to IW7) that help to stabilize the enzyme’s conformation. Additional water-interacting residues, including D111, Y115, and H155, participate in these networks, further contributing to the rigid architecture required for efficient catalysis under various conditions (dey2018putativeroleof pages 1-2, dey2018putativeroleof pages 8-9).

Finally, stabilizing salt bridge-forming residues, although discussed more extensively in comparative studies of GH11 xylanases, are also inferred to be conserved in T. lanuginosus xylanase. For example, the Asp94–Arg149 salt bridge contributes to maintaining a tight overall fold and linking key structural regions, a feature that is shared by thermostable variants and supports both function and thermal stability (vucinic2021acomparativestudy pages 16-18, vucinic2021acomparativestudy pages 28-28).

Collectively, the evidence from structural comparisons, mutagenesis studies, and molecular dynamics simulations indicates that the catalytic glutamates (Glu77 and Glu170), substrate-stabilizing tyrosines (Tyr87 and Tyr172), aromatic residues forming long-range interaction networks (Tyr77, Tyr78, Trp138), and residues involved in invariant water molecule stabilization (H144, R145, along with D111, Y115, H155) are highly conserved in GH11 xylanases. These residues synergistically ensure the enzyme’s proper catalytic function and its structural robustness under thermal stress (briganti2021structuralandmolecular pages 4-6, dey2018putativeroleof pages 4-5, ramakumar2018roleoflongrange pages 12-15, vucinic2021acomparativestudy pages 16-18)."
Modular xylanase Xyn10B ( C. thermocellum ),2W5F,A,E96,Catalytic nucleophile essential for double-displacement mechanism and TIM barrel stability.,"john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 34-35, john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 35-39",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"Modular xylanase Xyn10B from Clostridium thermocellum (PDB 2W5F chain A) exhibits a conserved catalytic domain with the classic (β/α)₈ TIM barrel fold, and its structure–function integrity is maintained by several highly conserved residues across homologues.

First, two catalytic glutamate residues are absolutely essential. In GH10 xylanases these glutamates act as the catalytic nucleophile and acid/base respectively, driving the double‐displacement mechanism that retains the anomeric configuration during hydrolysis. Their strict conservation in homologues indicates that they are central to both catalysis and the overall stability of the TIM barrel fold (john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 34-35, john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 35-39).

In addition to the catalytic glutamates, several residues involved in substrate binding are conserved and directly linked to enzyme function. Lys54 is one such residue; it forms hydrogen bonds with xylose moieties at the substrate’s –1 subsite and may also engage adjacent sugar units, stabilizing the binding configuration. This multifunctionality underpins substrate recognition and precise positioning during catalysis (talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 7-9).

Trp301 is another highly conserved residue. Its aromatic side chain contributes to stacking interactions with the pyranose ring of the substrate, thus playing a key role in orienting and stabilizing the xylan chain within the active site. The preservation of Trp301 among homologues underscores its significance in maintaining the substrate-binding cleft’s architecture (talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 7-9).

Further contributing to substrate stabilization are the polar residues His91, Asn143, and Gln220. These residues are strategically positioned in the substrate-binding cleft to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups of the xylose units. Their roles extend beyond mere binding: by ensuring precise substrate orientation, they facilitate an optimal environment for catalysis while reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site (talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 7-9, talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 4-6).

There is also strong evidence for the structural role of a cluster of aromatic residues. In homologous xylanases, residues such as Phe313, Tyr189, Phe192, Phe193, and Trp231 are implicated in forming hydrophobic pockets and stacking interactions that define the substrate binding groove. Their aromatic character is critical for creating a complementary surface that accommodates decorated xylan chains, and their conservation across family members highlights their dual contribution to substrate specificity and overall fold stability (talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 6-7, talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 7-9).

Finally, while the catalytic domain is the principal focus, the enzyme’s modularity also plays a role in stability. Xyn10B features N- and C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module 22 (CBM22) domains. Although specific residues within these modules are not detailed in the provided excerpts, experimental evidence and comparative studies imply that residues at the interface of the CBM and catalytic domain—involving hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts—contribute to the overall thermostability and proper folding of the enzyme (meng2015distinctrolesfor pages 6-7, john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 47-51).

In summary, the highly conserved residues in modular xylanase Xyn10B include the catalytic glutamates (essential for the double-displacement mechanism), Lys54, Trp301, His91, Asn143, and Gln220 (vital for substrate binding and stabilization), along with additional aromatic residues (Phe313, Tyr189, Phe192, Phe193, Trp231) that reinforce the active site’s structural integrity. These residue contributions are supported by crystallographic studies, sequence conservation analyses, and biochemical assays spanning multiple investigations into GH10 xylanases (john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 34-35, john2006endoxylanasesfromglycosyl pages 35-39, talensperales2021phylogeneticfunctionaland pages 7-9)."

A central catalytic triad is formed by Asp231, Glu261, and Asp328. Asp231 is the nucleophile that directly attacks the glycosidic bond during hydrolysis, while Glu261 functions as the proton donor, its protonation state being essential for acid–base catalysis; Asp328 assists by forming hydrogen bonds with substrate moieties and by modulating the pKa of Glu261, thereby ensuring efficient catalysis. This three‐residue arrangement is supported by detailed mutational and structural studies that have consistently shown near‐complete loss of enzyme activity upon their substitution (liu2012improvementofthe pages 6-7, macgregor1988αamylasestructureand pages 10-12).

Substrate binding is mediated by residues that position the starch substrate within the active site. Notably, His105 and His235 function as substrate‐binding residues. His105 participates in forming the binding pocket, while His235 not only reinforces substrate binding but also plays a role in stabilizing the conserved calcium ion (Ca1) at the active site, contributing indirectly to proper active site conformation (liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5). Additionally, His289 has been noted in some studies as interacting with substrate molecules, further fine‐tuning substrate affinity (liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5).

Structural integrity and proper enzyme folding are also dependent on a network of residues that coordinate metal ions essential for both thermostability and enzymatic function. Several residues located at the interface of the central A domain and the overlying B domain contribute to the formation and stabilization of a tri‐metal binding site. For instance, Asp200 is critical because it ligands the conserved calcium ion (Ca1) and a central sodium ion, playing a decisive role in structural integrity. Likewise, Asp202 and Asp204, which coordinate a second calcium ion (Ca2) and contribute to the electrostatic network essential for thermostability, are intolerant to substitution and their mutation leads to significant loss of activity. Lys237 forms a salt bridge with Asp204, further stabilizing the metal binding site. Moreover, Asn192 contributes by forming hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues (Asp194 and Asp183), which helps to maintain the proper conformation around the metal ion binding pocket (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11).

The enzyme’s flexible loop region spanning residues 178 to 199 undergoes a conformational transition upon calcium binding. This loop contains additional critical residues such as Glu189 (as part of the ionic interaction with Lys234) and Met197, which together assist in substrate recognition and maintain domain architecture for both biochemical function and thermostability (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11).

Additional modulators of enzyme stability and function include residues whose mutations either enhance or detract from overall enzyme performance. For example, mutations such as Asn190Phe have been documented to significantly increase thermostability, albeit sometimes at a cost to catalytic activity; this illustrates how subtle alterations in non‐active site residues can indirectly affect biochemical function (declerck2003hyperthermostabilizationofbacillus pages 2-3).

Collectively, the evidence consistently marks Asp231, Glu261, and Asp328 as the core catalytic residues, while His105 and His235 are indispensable for substrate binding. The metal-binding network—especially involving Asn192, Asp200, Asp202, Asp204, and Lys237—is equally critical, ensuring that the active site remains properly structured and functional under diverse biochemical conditions (liu2012improvementofthe pages 6-7, declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11, liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5)."

One group is centered on the metal‐binding region and its immediate loop, and the other arises from flexible surface regions identified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

1. Metal‐Binding and Interdomain Region  
The critical loop spanning residues 178–199—which undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon calcium binding—is a major site of conformational switching. Within and adjacent to this loop, several residues are directly or indirectly involved in coordinating the triadic Ca–Na–Ca metal‐binding site and stabilizing the interdomain contacts between domain A and domain B. For example:  

• Asp200 and Asp204 directly coordinate the bound calcium ions and are highly intolerant to substitution; mutations here produce dramatic losses in enzyme half‐life, indicating that their precise interactions are essential for maintaining the conformation of the active site and the overall stability of the enzyme (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 1-2, declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11).  

• Asn192, which participates in hydrogen bonding networks stabilizing the metal‐binding site, is equally sensitive to mutation and is therefore critical in maintaining the conformational state required for proper metal coordination and enzyme function (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11).  

• Additional residues such as Asp202 and Lys237 support the metal-binding configuration—with Asp202 helping to coordinate the second calcium ion and Lys237 forming salt bridges that ensure the structural integrity of the site. Their roles are highlighted by the dramatic loss of thermostability upon mutation, suggesting their involvement in cooperativity during unfolding/refolding events that are conceptually similar to allosteric changes (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11, declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 16-17).  

• The salt bridge between Asp121 and Arg127 further reinforces the active arrangement of the metal-binding region, indirectly contributing to the regulation of enzyme conformation under thermal and biochemical stress (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 1-2).  

• His235, which binds one of the conserved calcium ions, is also central to maintaining appropriate orientation of the active site, linking metal binding with the preservation of the critical catalytic conformation (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11).

2. Flexible Surface Regions  
Computational studies with MD simulations and FoldX analyses have identified a distinct group of surface-exposed residues that, although located more than 5 Å away from the catalytic triad, modulate local dynamics that can facilitate conformational switching:  

• K251, E271, T277, N278, and K319 are found within flexible regions (e.g., parts of loops or α-helices), and mutations in these residues have been shown to enhance thermostability and activity. In particular, MD-based RMSF analyses revealed that these positions are dynamic at elevated temperatures, suggesting that their modulation alters the protein’s conformational landscape (fan2024computationaldesignof pages 3-5).  

• E271 is especially notable because its mutation (e.g., E271L) disrupts hydrogen bonding with nearby K315 and H316 in a loop motif, increasing local entropy. This change is proposed to facilitate conformational switching that adjusts the enzyme’s stability under heat stress (fan2024computationaldesignof pages 5-6, fan2024computationaldesignof pages 6-7).  

• E336 has been implicated in regulating loop dynamics near the catalytic residue D328. Mutations such as E336S disrupt local hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, thereby enhancing the flexibility of an adjacent loop. This increased flexibility may allow structural rearrangements that optimize substrate access and catalytic efficiency—a mechanism akin to allosteric regulation (fan2024computationaldesignof pages 6-7).

In summary, the residues Asp200, Asp204, Asn192, Asp202, and Lys237 (along with supportive interactions such as the Asp121–Arg127 salt bridge and His235 coordination) form a metal-binding and interdomain network that is intimately linked to enzyme conformational stability and switching. In parallel, the flexible surface residues K251, E271, T277, N278, K319, and E336 modulate the conformational dynamics of the enzyme and are promising targets for enhancing thermostability and catalytic activity through altered allosteric-like regulation (declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 1-2, declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 9-11, declerck2000probingstructuraldeterminants pages 16-17, fan2024computationaldesignof pages 3-5, fan2024computationaldesignof pages 5-6, fan2024computationaldesignof pages 6-7)."

Below is a detailed account of these residues, the structural and biochemical evidence for their roles, and the literature sources that support these conclusions:

1. Catalytic Triad and Active‐Site Binding (D231, E261, D328):  
The enzyme’s active site is located in the C‐terminal end of the (β/α)8 TIM barrel. In particular, the aspartate–glutamate–aspartate triad—D231, E261, and D328—plays a dual role in substrate binding and catalysis. D231 acts as the nucleophile, E261 functions as the proton donor at the +1 subsite by interacting via hydrogen bonding with hydroxyls on the substrate, and D328 helps stabilize the transition state. These residues make direct contacts with the bound ligand (e.g., acarbose), as shown by high‐resolution crystallographic analyses (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 6-9).

2. Hydrogen‐Bonding Network Contributing to Substrate Orientation (H327, H105, R229):  
Additional stabilization of the substrate within the active‐site cleft is provided by hydrogen‐bonding residues. H327 interacts with oxygen atoms of the ligand, while H105 has been observed to stabilize the positioning of D231 and contribute to substrate coordination. R229 further supports ligand binding by interacting with oxygen atoms from the carbohydrate moieties, ensuring proper substrate orientation for efficient catalysis. The combined effects of these residues are illustrated by detailed ligand–protein interaction maps from crystallographic studies (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 6-9).

3. Aromatic Residues for Stacking Interactions (Y56, Y290):  
Aromatic residues are central in mediating substrate specificity through stacking interactions. Y56 and Y290 are positioned within the active‐site cleft so that they can form aromatic stacking interactions with the sugar rings of the substrate. Such stacking interactions stabilize the carbohydrate substrate, ensuring proper alignment within the binding subsites and contributing to substrate specificity (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 6-9).

4. Surface Binding Site (SBS) Residues (F257, Y358):  
Beyond the catalytic cleft, the enzyme contains a distinct starch surface binding site (SBS) that facilitates adsorption onto raw starch surfaces. In this SBS, F257 and Y358 have been identified as essential mediators of ligand complex formation. They participate in hydrophobic stacking interactions with the sugar rings, which not only reinforce substrate binding but also enhance processivity by maintaining proximity to the substrate during hydrolysis. Mutagenesis data—where individual mutations (F257A or Y358A) and the double mutant (F257A/Y358A) showed significant decreases in raw starch binding and catalytic efficiency—provide strong support for their critical functions (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 1-4, bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 9-11).

5. Supporting and Distal Binding Residues:  
Some additional residues—such as those seen in remote acarbose‐binding groups (e.g., G357, E355, P317, as well as residues from the N terminus like T38 and E255)—have been observed in crystallographic structures as contributing to ligand interactions. Although these residues are not part of the primary active‐site architecture, they help define a broader substrate–binding interface, further modulating substrate specificity (tan2008crystalstructureof pages 5-6, tan2008crystalstructureof pages 7-10).

Together, the evidence from X‐ray crystallography, site‐directed mutagenesis, and detailed kinetic studies shows that ligand/substrate binding in B. licheniformis α‐amylase (PDB 1BLI chain A) is a multi‐residue process. The catalytic triad (D231, E261, D328) establishes the core of the active site, whereas hydrogen‐bonding residues (H327, H105, R229) and aromatic residues (Y56, Y290) ensure proper substrate positioning and stabilization. In addition, a specialized surface binding site incorporating F257 and Y358 facilitates effective engagement of raw starch substrates, thereby enhancing overall enzymatic efficiency (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 1-4, bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 6-9, bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 9-11, tan2008crystalstructureof pages 5-6, tan2008crystalstructureof pages 7-10)."

In particular, the aspartate–glutamate–aspartate triad—D231, E261, and D328—plays a dual role in substrate binding and catalysis. D231 acts as the nucleophile, E261 functions as the proton donor at the +1 subsite by interacting via hydrogen bonding with hydroxyls on the substrate, and D328 helps stabilize the transition state. These residues make direct contacts with the bound ligand (e.g., acarbose), as shown by high‐resolution crystallographic analyses (bozic2020characterizationofthe pages 6-9).

2. Hydrogen‐Bonding Network Contributing to Substrate Orientation (H327, H105, R229):

α-Amylase ( B. licheniformis ),1BLI,A,D198,Asp231 acts as the nucleophile in the catalytic triad.,"Liu2012improvementofthe pages 6-7, Liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The Bacillus licheniformis α‐amylase (PDB: 1BLI chain A) displays several highly conserved residues that have been repeatedly implicated in catalytic function as well as in maintaining structural stability. Among these, the catalytic triad—comprising Asp231, Glu261, and Asp328—is of paramount importance. Asp231 acts as the nucleophile that initiates the hydrolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond, Glu261 functions as the proton donor necessary for glycosidic oxygen activation, and Asp328 supports the reaction by stabilizing substrate binding and influencing the pKa of the catalytic glutamate. This catalytic triad is not only essential for enzymatic activity but is also remarkably conserved among α‐amylases, underscoring its evolutionary importance across homologues (Liu2012improvementofthe pages 6-7, Liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5).

In addition to the catalytic residues, substrate binding residues such as His105 and His235 have been noted as critical contributors to the enzyme’s functionality. These histidine residues participate in substrate recognition and binding by interacting with the carbohydrate moiety, thereby ensuring proper substrate orientation towards the active site. Their conservation across homologues highlights their dual role in both substrate specificity and stabilization of the transition state during catalysis (Liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5).

The enzyme’s structural integrity also relies on the correct coordination of calcium ions. Although specific Ca²⁺‐coordinating residues in 1BLI are not itemized in every study, multiple sources indicate that calcium binding is integral to the thermostability and folding of α‐amylases. In many homologues, groups of Asp, Glu, and Asn residues orchestrate the binding of Ca²⁺, thereby rigidifying structural elements and reducing conformational flexibility that might otherwise lead to thermal inactivation (Ochiai2014crystalstructureof pages 7-8, Li2015roleoftwo pages 8-9).

Further, certain residues contribute to stability through the formation of electrostatic interactions such as salt bridges. For example, the salt bridge between Arg176 and Glu126 has been identified as a key stabilizing force in related Bacillus enzymes. Although this specific salt bridge is drawn from comparative studies with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, its presence in B. licheniformis α‐amylase is consistent with the conservation of such charged residue pairs in maintaining overall protein stability under thermal stress (Li2015roleoftwo pages 9-9).

Additional residues that have been targeted for engineering to improve acid and thermal stability include Thr353 and His400. Mutagenesis experiments—such as substituting Thr353 with isoleucine and His400 with arginine—demonstrate that these modifications can enhance catalytic efficiency under acidic conditions without compromising the enzyme’s thermostability. These residues are thought to modulate the local hydrogen bonding network and surface hydrophilicity, affecting the pKa of key catalytic groups while maintaining the overall folding of the enzyme (Liu2012improvementofthe pages 4-6, Liu2012improvementofthe pages 7-9).

Finally, consensus-based design studies have also identified residues like Thr139 and Thr258 as structurally important, with mutations at these positions (e.g., to valine) leading to improved thermostability by enhancing hydrophobic packing in the enzyme’s core. This further underscores the concept that conserved residues across homologues can play subtle yet critical roles in protein folding and long-term stability (Cui2022simultaneouslyimprovingthe pages 1-3).

Collectively, residues Asp231, Glu261, Asp328 (catalytic triad), His105, His235 (substrate binding), as well as calcium- and salt-bridge-coordinating residues such as those forming Ca²⁺ binding sites and the Arg176–Glu126 pair, alongside modifiable positions like Thr353, His400, Thr139, and Thr258, are highly conserved in Bacillus licheniformis α‐amylase and its homologues.

These residues are thought to modulate the local hydrogen bonding network and surface hydrophilicity, affecting the pKa of key catalytic groups while maintaining the overall folding of the enzyme (Liu2012improvementofthe pages 4-6, Liu2012improvementofthe pages 7-9).

Finally, consensus-based design studies have also identified residues like Thr139 and Thr258 as structurally important, with mutations at these positions (e.g., to valine) leading to improved thermostability by enhancing hydrophobic packing in the enzyme’s core. This further underscores the concept that conserved residues across homologues can play subtle yet critical roles in protein folding and long-term stability (Cui2022simultaneouslyimprovingthe pages 1-3).

Collectively, residues Asp231, Glu261, Asp328 (catalytic triad), His105, His235 (substrate binding), as well as calcium- and salt-bridge-coordinating residues such as those forming Ca²⁺ binding sites and the Arg176–Glu126 pair, alongside modifiable positions like Thr353, His400, Thr139, and Thr258, are highly conserved in Bacillus licheniformis α‐amylase and its homologues. Their conservation and experimentally demonstrated roles in catalysis, substrate interaction, and structural stability firmly establish them as the key determinants of enzymatic function in this protein (Liu2012improvementofthe pages 6-7, Liu2014ahighlyactive pages 3-5, Ochiai2014crystalstructureof pages 7-8)."

For example, the residue Proline at position 44 (P44) has been repeatedly discussed. In the work by Hu et al., P44 is described as a key hinge located at the periphery of the active pocket whose mutation (P44E) alleviates conformational crowding, optimizes the hydrogen bond network, and consequently enhances both activity and thermal stability, indirectly implying an increase in thermostability parameters such as Tm or ΔG° (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11).

Domain‐specific studies also identify residues in loop regions that modulate flexibility and rigidity to affect thermostability. Several residues along the major conformational motion pathway have been highlighted, including Leucine 202 (L202), Tyrosine 364 (Y364), Cysteine 361 (C361), Phenylalanine 363 (F363), Lysine 345 (K345), and Tyrosine 359 (Y359). Hu et al. report that mutations at these positions (with the exceptions of T354 and F363, where the mutated versions exhibited decreased activity) result in significant improvements in activity and stability.

In addition to the residues within the motion pathway, the extra loop in the B domain has also been shown to contribute to thermostability in related α‐amylases. In the study by Khemakhem et al., residues in the region of the extra loop – specifically Glycine 213 (G213), Isoleucine 214 (I214), Glycine 215 (G215), along with neighboring Arginine 212 (R212) and Lysine 216 (K216) – are identified as crucial. For instance, deletion experiments targeting parts of this loop resulted in measurable changes in thermostability, with specific deletions enhancing the Tm and resistance to destabilizing agents such as EDTA. The interactions among these residues help maintain a balance between flexibility and rigidity, where I214 is noted for rerouting its oxygen interactions from K216 to G213, thereby modulating the structural constraints necessary for efficient calcium binding, which in turn affects thermal stability (khemakhem2009theimportanceof pages 5-6, khemakhem2009theimportanceof pages 6-6).

While Hu et al. primarily focus on residues influencing conformational motion and enzyme kinetics, their discussion of these key residues—especially P44, L202, Y364, C361, F363, K345, and Y359—underscores the concept that modifications in surface or loop regions can directly alter the thermodynamic stability of the protein by affecting factors such as hydrogen bond networks, channel properties, and overall structural dynamics (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5).

First, the catalytic triad itself is composed of Asp232, Glu262, and Asp329. Asp232 acts as the nucleophile, directly attacking the glycosidic bond to form a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate—a role that is critical for the double-displacement mechanism of α-amylase catalysis (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5, macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4). Glu262 functions as the Brønsted acid/base catalyst, donating and abstracting protons during the reaction cycle, a role that is supported by its direct interaction with a sodium ion which mimics the positive charge of the transition state (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5, borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 5-5). Asp329, the third residue, is essential in stabilizing the transition state; its position enables it to coordinate the substrate’s O2 and O3 hydroxyls, thereby facilitating proper distortion needed for efficient glycosidic bond cleavage (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5, matsuura2002apossiblemechanism pages 3-5).

Beyond this catalytic core, additional residues play crucial roles in substrate binding and the overall biochemical function of the enzyme. According to mutagenesis and hydrogen bonding analyses, His236 has been shown to form a key hydrogen bond with the −3 sugar subsite, which is important for proper substrate positioning (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11). Similarly, His106 and His328 contribute to binding at the −2 subsite, further stabilizing the substrate as it enters the active site (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11). In concert with these histidine residues, aromatic residue Tyr57 participates in substrate binding via aromatic stacking with the −1 sugar ring, thus enhancing substrate recognition and positioning (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11).

The sodium ion found in the structure interacts specifically with Asp232 and Glu262. This interaction underscores the role of metal ions in stabilizing the transition state during catalysis. The positive charge provided by the sodium ion effectively mimics the charge development that occurs in the oxocarbenium-like transition state, and thereby contributes to the catalytic efficiency (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 5-5).

The highly conserved nature of these residues is further reinforced by structural and mutagenesis studies in related α-amylases, where even minor perturbations in the triad or the substrate-binding residues result in dramatic reductions in enzymatic activity (lim2020structurepredictionof pages 3-6, n.2003anoverviewof pages 1-3). This sequence and structural conservation across the glycosyl hydrolase family 13 highlights the indispensability of these amino acids for the enzyme’s catalytic function (macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4, matsuura2002apossiblemechanism pages 1-3).

In summary, PDB 1HVX chain A of G. stearothermophilus α‐amylase depends on a catalytic triad—Asp232 acting as the nucleophile, Glu262 serving as the acid/base catalyst, and Asp329 stabilizing the transition state—for efficient cleavage of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Complementing these are substrate-binding residues His236, His106, His328, and Tyr57, which ensure proper substrate interaction and orientation. Together with metal ion stabilization (via a bound sodium ion), these conserved residues underpin both the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism and its biochemical function (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11, macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4)."
α-Amylase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1HVX,A,T321,"Mutation reduced activity, indicating role in channel architecture.","hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13",literature,T353C,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available evidence points to several key residues in the G. stearothermophilus α‐amylase structure (PDB 1HVX chain A) whose mutagenesis and computational analyses suggest roles in allosteric regulation and conformational switching.

A dominant role is played by proline 44 (P44). This residue is repeatedly highlighted as a pivotal hinge in the enzyme’s motion pathway. Experimental mutation of P44 to glutamic acid (P44E) resulted in increased channel bottleneck radius, enhanced substrate access, improved thermal stability, and elevated enzymatic activity. These changes underscore its role in alleviating conformational hindrance and reorganizing the hydrogen bonding network at the catalytic center, thereby facilitating allosteric modulation and conformational switching (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 11-12, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 1-2).

In addition to P44, computational methods identified a conserved dance along the dominant motion pathway that begins with residues P207, L202, and V103, and continues with P44 and Y364. These residues, situated in and around the substrate binding cleft between structural Domains A and B, were consistently predicted to participate in dynamic motions. Their presence in the foremost positions of the motion pathway suggests that they contribute to the initial structural transitions that underlie allosteric effects (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11).

Further downstream in the motion network, residues located between positions 345 and 366 appear to be critical modulators of enzyme function. For instance, lysine 345 (K345) has been mutated to isoleucine (K345I), a change that correlates with a significant increase in catalytic efficiency and augmented substrate hydrolysis. This residue is likely involved in stabilizing domain interactions that are critical for conformational switching (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9).

Similarly, tyrosine 359 (Y359) is another residue that, upon mutation to threonine (Y359T), showed improved enzymatic activity. The mutation is postulated to modify the physicochemical properties at the substrate binding channel, such that optimal substrate access and subsequent turnover are enhanced via subtle structural rearrangements (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9).

Tyrosine 364 (Y364) features as one of the first five conserved residues in the dominant motion pathway, implying its importance not just in catalytic interactions but also in maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for allosteric switching. Its involvement appears to be linked to the stabilization of the substrate interaction network, thereby facilitating proper alignment of substrates for efficient catalysis (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11).

Additional residues in the 354–366 stretch also contribute to these dynamic regulatory mechanisms. Threonine 354 (T354), glutamine 356 (Q356), cysteine 361 (C361), phenylalanine 363 (F363), and aspartate 366 (D366) were all targeted by mutation, with varying effects on hydrolysis efficiency, channel architecture, and thermal stability. For example, while mutations at T354 (T354C) and F363 (F363H) resulted in reduced activity, alterations at Q356 (Q356P) and C361 (C361M) contributed positively to enzyme performance. These findings indicate that the structural interplay of these residues helps to fine-tune the enzyme’s conformational landscape, likely serving as a network of control points for allosteric regulation (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13).

Collectively, the evidence builds a picture where the residues that participate in the conformational motion pathway—and by extension, in allosteric switching—include P44, P207, L202, V103, Y364, along with those from the more variable stretch between residues 345 and 366 (including K345, Y359, T354, Q356, C361, F363, and D366). Their roles are supported by computational predictions via neural relational inference and further validated by directed mutagenesis experiments, which demonstrate that altering these positions significantly affects substrate access, hydrogen bond formation, and the enzyme’s thermal stability. Consequently, these residues form part of a dynamic framework that governs the allosteric and conformational control of the enzyme, making them prime targets for rational design aimed at enhancing enzyme functionality (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 11-12, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13)."

This residue is likely involved in stabilizing domain interactions that are critical for conformational switching (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9).

Similarly, tyrosine 359 (Y359) is another residue that, upon mutation to threonine (Y359T), showed improved enzymatic activity. The mutation is postulated to modify the physicochemical properties at the substrate binding channel, such that optimal substrate access and subsequent turnover are enhanced via subtle structural rearrangements (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9).

Tyrosine 364 (Y364) features as one of the first five conserved residues in the dominant motion pathway, implying its importance not just in catalytic interactions but also in maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for allosteric switching. Its involvement appears to be linked to the stabilization of the substrate interaction network, thereby facilitating proper alignment of substrates for efficient catalysis (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 9-11).

Additional residues in the 354–366 stretch also contribute to these dynamic regulatory mechanisms. Threonine 354 (T354), glutamine 356 (Q356), cysteine 361 (C361), phenylalanine 363 (F363), and aspartate 366 (D366) were all targeted by mutation, with varying effects on hydrolysis efficiency, channel architecture, and thermal stability. For example, while mutations at T354 (T354C) and F363 (F363H) resulted in reduced activity, alterations at Q356 (Q356P) and C361 (C361M) contributed positively to enzyme performance. These findings indicate that the structural interplay of these residues helps to fine-tune the enzyme’s conformational landscape, likely serving as a network of control points for allosteric regulation (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 5-6, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 6-9, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13).

Collectively, the evidence builds a picture where the residues that participate in the conformational motion pathway—and by extension, in allosteric switching—include P44, P207, L202, V103, Y364, along with those from the more variable stretch between residues 345 and 366 (including K345, Y359, T354, Q356, C361, F363, and D366). Their roles are supported by computational predictions via neural relational inference and further validated by directed mutagenesis experiments, which demonstrate that altering these positions significantly affects substrate access, hydrogen bond formation, and the enzyme’s thermal stability. Consequently, these residues form part of a dynamic framework that governs the allosteric and conformational control of the enzyme, making them prime targets for rational design aimed at enhancing enzyme functionality (hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 11-12, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 3-5, hu2023modifyingtheamino pages 12-13)."
α-Amylase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1HVX,A,W266,Forms CH/π-stacking interaction with Glc4 and T-shaped stacking with Y260 in CBM58.,baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 6-7,literature,,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"Geobacillus stearothermophilus α‐amylase (PDB 1HVX chain A) utilizes a combination of aromatic, hydrophobic, and polar/charged residues at two distinct binding regions – the carbohydrate‐binding module (CBM58) and a secondary surface‐binding site (SBS) – to mediate substrate binding and specificity.

At the CBM58 region, ligand binding is primarily stabilized by aromatic residues that establish CH/π‐stacking interactions with the glucose rings of maltooligosaccharides. Two key tryptophan residues, W287 and W299, are involved in these stacking interactions; W287 interacts with the third glucose unit (Glc3) and W299 with the fourth (Glc4). In addition, W299 is thought to form a T‐shaped stacking interaction with tyrosine Y260, reinforcing the aromatic network. This aromatic clustering is complemented by the hydrophobic contribution of L290, which further stabilizes the substrate’s position. Several polar interactions support the complex: E263 forms a hydrogen bond with the O6 of Glc2, while N330 interacts via hydrogen bonds with O2 and O3 of Glc3. Moreover, Y260 is also involved in hydrogen bonding with O6 of Glc3, and K304 forms hydrogen bonds with O2 and O3 of Glc4. The cumulative effect of these interactions ensures a precise orientation and stable binding of the ligand (baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 6-7).

At the secondary starch‐binding surface (SBS), binding and specificity are again dominated by aromatic interactions. Here, residues W460 and Y469 form critical CH/π‐stacking contacts with Glc4 and Glc2, respectively, thereby anchoring the substrate on the enzyme surface. In support of these interactions, additional polar residues at the SBS contribute hydrogen bonds; specifically, D437 forms a hydrogen bond with the O1 of Glc6, R457 with O2 of Glc4, D473 forms hydrogen bonds with both O2 and O3 of Glc3, and K472 interacts with O2 of Glc2. Mutational analyses have shown that substitutions such as W460A, Y469A, or D473V cause a marked reduction in starch‐binding capacity and enzymatic activity, providing strong evidence for their functional roles (baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 6-7, baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 8-10).

In the broader context of GH13 family enzymes, as detailed by macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4 and williams2014structuralstudiesof pages 28-33, substrate recognition is also mediated by conserved catalytic residues that form the (β/α)₈-barrel active site. Although the exact catalytic carboxylates (typically an aspartate, a glutamate, and another aspartate) are not explicitly enumerated for pdb 1HVX in the provided excerpts, these invariant residues are universally critical to cleaving the α-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages. Structural and mutagenesis studies on other α‐amylases (e.g., Brayer2000subsitemappingof pages 1-2, Brayer2000subsitemappingof pages 7-10) support that these catalytic residues, along with the binding subsites that accommodate multiple sugar units, contribute to both ligand binding and specificity. Such conserved features assure that substrate binding is not only directional and specific but also properly aligned for catalysis (macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4, williams2014structuralstudiesof pages 28-33).

In summary, the ligand‐binding and specificity in Geobacillus stearothermophilus α‐amylase are predominantly mediated by:
• Aromatic residues at CBM58: W287, W299, and Y260, supported by L290.

• Aromatic and polar residues at the SBS: W460, Y469, D437, R457, D473, and K472.
Together, these residues create a finely tuned network of hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions that facilitate effective substrate engagement and catalysis (baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 6-7, baroroh2017theimportanceof pages 8-10, macgregor2001relationshipofsequence pages 3-4)."

α-Amylase ( G. stearothermophilus ),1HVX,A,D197,Asp232 functions as the nucleophile in the catalytic triad.,borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The α‐amylase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB 1HVX chain A) exhibits several residues that are highly conserved across homologues and critically underpin both catalytic function and structural stability.

One set of critical residues is located in the active site, forming the catalytic triad. In 1HVX, Asp232 functions as the nucleophile, Glu262 serves as the Brønsted acid/base, and Asp329 acts as a helper residue that stabilizes the transition state by coordinating substrate hydroxyl groups. The conservation of these residues not only defines the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism as typical for GH13 family α‐amylases but also ensures the integrity of the (β/α)8-barrel active site fold. Structural studies using the TVB146 variant and comparisons with Bacillus licheniformis α‐amylase support the importance of these residues and their interactions with bound ions (borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 3-5).

Closely associated with the catalytic center is a peculiar metal ion binding motif. A Ca2+-Na+-Ca2+ triad is present in 1HVX and is essential for maintaining structural stability. Specifically, one calcium ion (CaI) is strictly conserved and its coordination is critical for rigidifying the protein scaffold. This triad, with direct interactions involving residues that are often aspartate or glutamate (and occasionally asparagine), is positioned to support both the active site conformation and the overall domain architecture. The sodium ion observed in the catalytic center further stabilizes the transition state by mimicking a positive charge, interacting closely with Asp232 and Glu262. This arrangement is well-documented by crystallographic comparisons and molecular dynamics simulations (ali2006thermostabilityenhancementand pages 2-3, borchert2015threedimensionalstructureof pages 5-5).

Additional conserved residues contribute indirectly to the enzyme’s function through substrate recognition and maintaining inter-domain interactions. For instance, Asn315, although not directly catalytic, plays a role in modulating starch hydrolysis profiles by influencing substrate binding and potentially stabilization of secondary structure elements away from the active site. Similarly, Val450, located in domain C, affects enzyme function likely through its role in maintaining the proper spatial orientation of adjacent structural elements. These observations are reinforced by mutagenesis experiments that, while not perturbing the global structure significantly, altered the hydrolysis profile by tweaking how substrates interact with the enzyme (ali2006thermostabilityenhancementand pages 3-5).

Furthermore, aromatic and polar residues surrounding the active region are conserved and critical. Key aromatic residues such as Trp266 and Phe289 contribute to the formation of a well-organized substrate binding groove by stabilizing the active site via hydrophobic and π–π interactions. Moreover, histidine residues—exemplified by His222 (notably equivalent to His238/His269 in related species)—affect both the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency and stability through hydrogen bonding and favorable electrostatic interactions near the active center (damianalmazo2008enhancementofthe pages 8-9).

Finally, the overall structural rigidity observed in 1HVX is bolstered by a network of conserved residues that coordinate additional calcium ions at secondary binding sites, such as the second Ca2+ (CaIII) which bridges domain A (housing the TIM-barrel) with domain C. In some psychrophilic versus mesophilic comparisons, the presence of less positively charged residues (for example, Ser406 and Gly431 in 1HVX) in the vicinity of the Ca2+(III) site has been linked to enhanced stabilization of the enzyme’s three-dimensional structure (bendtsen2025coldactivestarchdegradingenzymes pages 22-24, bendtsen2025coldactivestarchdegradingenzymes pages 24-26).

In summary, the conserved residues in 1HVX chain A that are integral to its function and stability include the catalytic triad (Asp232, Glu262, Asp329), key metal‐ion coordinating residues that form the Ca2+-Na+-Ca2+ triad (with CaI being especially critical), and additional residues such as Asn315, Val450, aromatic residues (Trp266, Phe289), and histidine (His222) that contribute indirectly to substrate binding and the integrity of inter-domain communications.

The essential nature of Glu257, Asp229, and Asp328 is firmly supported by crystallographic and mutagenesis studies that consistently demonstrate their critical roles in maintaining catalytic efficiency (Han2014recentadvancesin pages 2-2, Rashid2002characterizationofan pages 1-2).

Second, residues outside the immediate catalytic center also influence enzyme activity by modulating substrate positioning and the dynamics of the active site. In particular, the starch-binding domain (domain E) is crucial for proper substrate alignment. In Bacillus circulans CGTase, a tyrosine residue in this domain—Tyr633 (the homolog of Tyr634 found in Bacillus macerans)—has been shown to be critical for substrate binding as well as for maintaining enzyme stability. Mutation studies replacing Tyr633 with glycine (Y633G) have resulted in approximately 25% increases in cyclization and starch-hydrolyzing activities, albeit at the cost of lowered thermostability, highlighting the fine balance between catalytic efficiency and enzyme stability mediated by this residue (Chang1998effectsofmutations pages 7-10, Chang1998effectsofmutations pages 10-12).

Additionally, Asp577, located in the calcium-binding site (CaIII) of the enzyme, plays an important modulatory role. Site-directed mutagenesis targeting Asp577 in a Bacillus circulans CGTase variant has revealed that alterations at this position can enhance cyclization activity. Specific substitutions, notably to arginine, have been found to improve catalytic efficiency while underscoring the role of calcium coordination in stabilizing the enzyme’s active conformation (Li2016asp577mutationsenhance pages 2-3).

The enzyme’s substrate binding subsites are also finely tuned by additional residues that influence product specificity. For example, Arg47, located at the donor -3 subsite, is integral for substrate positioning and thus affects the distribution of cyclodextrin products; mutations at this residue lead to shifted product profiles (Kelly2009theevolutionof pages 7-9). Furthermore, residues such as Asn94 in the -3 subsite also contribute to determining the size of the cyclodextrin rings produced, although these may be considered accessory to the core catalytic mechanism (Kelly2009theevolutionof pages 9-11).

In summary, the essential residues in Bacillus circulans CGTase (PDB 1CGT chain A) include Glu257, Asp229, and Asp328 in the catalytic center; Tyr633 in the starch-binding domain serving to align the substrate and regulate thermostability; and Asp577, located in a calcium-binding site, which modulates catalytic efficiency. Accessory residues such as Arg47 and Asn94 further refine substrate positioning and product specificity.

The enzyme’s active site is organized into several subsites that coordinate glucose moieties through hydrogen bonds, aromatic stacking, and hydrophobic interactions.

One major group comprises the catalytic triad. Asp229, Glu257, and Asp328 have dual functions: they are essential for the glycosidic bond cleavage mechanism and also contribute to substrate positioning. In particular, Asp229 is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with the C-6 hydroxyl group of a bound sugar and thus helps distort the sugar ring into a reactive conformation, as evidenced by mutagenesis experiments that show drastic loss of activity when substituted (knegtel1995crystallographicstudiesof pages 1-1, knegtel1995crystallographicstudiesof pages 8-9).

Additional aromatic residues in the active site serve to stabilize bound sugars by stacking with their glucose rings. Tyr100, found near the glycosidic linkage, participates in aromatic stacking that aids in substrate orientation (knegtel1995crystallographicstudiesof pages 4-4, knegtel1995crystallographicstudiesof pages 4-5). In parallel, Tyr89 in strain 251 CGTase engages in stacking interactions with the glucosyl units of maltononaose inhibitors—its presence distinguishes BC251 from thermostable homologs lacking an equivalent aromatic residue—and is critical for dictating product specificity (kalk1996thermoanaerobacteriumthermosulfurigenesem1 pages 8-10, kelly2009theevolutionof pages 7-9).

Substrate binding at the acceptor subsites also relies on a combination of aromatic and charged residues. Phe183, located at subsite +2, has been shown through mutation studies to be crucial for cyclization activity as replacement leads to diminished cyclization coupled with increased hydrolysis (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 4-6, kelly2009theevolutionof pages 7-9). In the same pocket, Lys232 contributes by forming specific hydrogen bonds that orient the substrate (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 4-6). Phe259 further stabilizes the acceptor substrate through hydrophobic interactions, reinforcing correct positioning during the nucleophilic attack (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 4-6).

Residues at the +1 subsite, such as Leu194 and Tyr195, are similarly critical. Tyr195, whose mutation can severely diminish cyclization activity, helps to position the nonreducing end of the covalent intermediate into the acceptor subsites, playing a pivotal role in product size specificity (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 6-7, kelly2009theevolutionof pages 9-11). Auxiliary residues like Ala230 and His233 further modulate the chemical environment at this subsite, influencing substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 6-7).

Loop regions, notably the segment encompassing residues 88–95, are key to donor subsite configuration. Within this flexible loop, residue N94 is selectively present in certain CGTases and impacts product specificity; mutations here have been linked to shifts in cyclodextrin production (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 7-9, kelly2009theevolutionof pages 9-11). Additionally, residues of donor subsites such as Arg47 (which, along with Asp/D371, helps stabilize the oligosaccharide chain) and those at subsite –6 (including Tyr167, Gly179, Gly180, and Asn193) support the formation of the cyclic product by engaging the elongated glucan chain (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 7-9).

Beyond the immediate active site, structural studies have identified further binding regions in the E-domain where cyclic oligosaccharides are accommodated. Aromatic residues such as Trp616, Trp662, and Tyr663 contribute to hydrophobic stacking with the apolar surfaces of cyclodextrin rings, while Leu600 may provide additional van der Waals support (knegtel1995crystallographicstudiesof pages 7-7, sorimachi1996solutionstructureof pages 12-13, veen2000engineeringofcyclodextrin pages 10-12).

First, three histidine residues—His140, His233, and His327—are fully conserved and essential for catalytic activity. His233, in particular, has been experimentally identified as the most reactive; its selective modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate or via ethoxyformylation significantly reduces both cyclization and hydrolytic activities. This observation confirms not only its role in electron relay during catalysis but also its participation in maintaining the active‐site architecture (costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 1-2, costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 2-3).

The classical catalytic triad, comprising Asp229, Glu257, and Asp328, is also highly conserved in glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzymes. Asp229 acts as the nucleophile, Glu257 functions as the acid/base catalyst, and Asp328 is involved in transition state stabilization during the double displacement reaction mechanism. Their conservation has been validated by mutagenesis, crystallographic studies, and biochemical analysis, underscoring their role in both catalysis and structural stabilization (kelly2009theevolutionof pages 14-15, rashid2002characterizationofan pages 1-2).

Additional residues outside the catalytic triad contribute to the proper orientation and binding of the starch substrate. Asp23 and Arg24 are completely conserved among CGTase homologues and are believed to play roles in maintaining the conformation of the active site and overall enzyme stability. Their invariant nature across species supports a critical function in proper enzyme folding and substrate positioning (costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 2-3).

Lys47 is another residue whose conservation is linked to product specificity; experimental evidence indicates that changes at this position correlate with the ratio of α- and β-cyclodextrin products. This suggests that Lys47 participates indirectly by influencing the geometry of the substrate binding pocket, therefore affecting the stabilization of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 2-3, jemli2012mutationsaffectingthe pages 7-8).

The subsite −6 normally harbors a glycine residue that is crucial for substrate binding via an induced-fit mechanism; however, in this particular CGTase variant a glutamine at position 179 replaces the typical glycine. Despite being an atypical substitution in Bacillus circulans CGTase, this residue highlights the delicate balance between conservation for catalytic efficiency and allowed variations for slight functional adjustments (costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 2-3).

Within the substrate binding and product specificity region, the ASET motif (positions 144–147) is unique to this enzyme when compared to other CGTases that predominantly produce β-cyclodextrins, pinpointing its role in accepting specific conformations of the substrate (costa2009structure–functionrelationshipin pages 2-3).

Trehalose synthase (TreS) from PDB 3ZO9 chain A identifies a set of residues that are critical for its catalytic and biochemical function. The primary catalytic machinery is organized as a conserved triad, augmented by additional side‐chains that mediate substrate binding, ion coordination, and oligomer stability.

First, the conserved catalytic triad is centered on three residues. Asp230 is the catalytic nucleophile that initiates the double‐displacement mechanism. Structural data reveal that Asp230 directly attacks the glycosidic bond during maltose conversion to trehalose. Its unusual ~90° flipped χ1 torsional angle – attributed to steric influence by Leu344 – underlines its unique active site configuration that seems to stabilize the formation of a covalent β–glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6). Adjacent to Asp230, Glu272 functions as the catalytic acid/base, facilitating proton transfers necessary for both bond cleavage and subsequent formation steps in the reaction (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5). The third component of the triad, Asp342, is located within the extended active site loop L7 (residues 338–384). This residue—not only conserved but also crucial for substrate binding—is positioned to interact with the sugar moiety, thereby contributing to the proper alignment of the substrate in the narrow, enclosed active site pocket (caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Beyond the catalytic triad, several additional residues contribute to the structural integrity and biochemical activity of TreS. Arg228 plays a dual role by anchoring a chloride ion close (approximately 8 Å) to the catalytic center. This ion-binding contributes to enzyme regulation and may stabilize the active conformation, as analogous sites exist in human α-amylases (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6). Leu344, although not directly catalytic, forces Asp230 into its unusual conformation; such steric hindrance is critical for modulating the active site architecture and ensuring the appropriate positioning of the nucleophile (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Additional residues that assist in substrate binding and maintain the active site’s structural organization include aromatic side chains and charged residues. Tyr93 and Phe194 are positioned to interact with a glucose moiety, similar to residues observed in the homologous trehalulose synthase MutB, thereby contributing to substrate stabilization within the active site (caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7). Furthermore, Arg421 forms hydrogen bonds that are important for substrate binding. Its role mirrors that of the corresponding arginine in MutB, indicating a conserved function in ligand orientation and stabilization (caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Collectively, the catalytic function of TreS in converting maltose to trehalose relies on a precisely organized set of residues. The catalytic triad (Asp230, Glu272, Asp342) is directly responsible for chemical transformation, while residues such as Arg228, Leu344, Tyr93, Phe194, and Arg421 provide the necessary structural support, substrate orientation, ion coordination, and allosteric regulation. These findings are derived from high-resolution crystallographic studies and sequence conservation analyses that reinforce the importance of each residue in catalysis and biochemical function (caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6)."

Structural data reveal that Asp230 directly attacks the glycosidic bond during maltose conversion to trehalose. Its unusual ~90° flipped χ1 torsional angle – attributed to steric influence by Leu344 – underlines its unique active site configuration that seems to stabilize the formation of a covalent β–glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6). Adjacent to Asp230, Glu272 functions as the catalytic acid/base, facilitating proton transfers necessary for both bond cleavage and subsequent formation steps in the reaction (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5). The third component of the triad, Asp342, is located within the extended active site loop L7 (residues 338–384). This residue—not only conserved but also crucial for substrate binding—is positioned to interact with the sugar moiety, thereby contributing to the proper alignment of the substrate in the narrow, enclosed active site pocket (caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Beyond the catalytic triad, several additional residues contribute to the structural integrity and biochemical activity of TreS. Arg228 plays a dual role by anchoring a chloride ion close (approximately 8 Å) to the catalytic center. This ion-binding contributes to enzyme regulation and may stabilize the active conformation, as analogous sites exist in human α-amylases (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6). Leu344, although not directly catalytic, forces Asp230 into its unusual conformation; such steric hindrance is critical for modulating the active site architecture and ensuring the appropriate positioning of the nucleophile (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Additional residues that assist in substrate binding and maintain the active site’s structural organization include aromatic side chains and charged residues. Tyr93 and Phe194 are positioned to interact with a glucose moiety, similar to residues observed in the homologous trehalulose synthase MutB, thereby contributing to substrate stabilization within the active site (caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7). Furthermore, Arg421 forms hydrogen bonds that are important for substrate binding. Its role mirrors that of the corresponding arginine in MutB, indicating a conserved function in ligand orientation and stabilization (caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Collectively, the catalytic function of TreS in converting maltose to trehalose relies on a precisely organized set of residues. The catalytic triad (Asp230, Glu272, Asp342) is directly responsible for chemical transformation, while residues such as Arg228, Leu344, Tyr93, Phe194, and Arg421 provide the necessary structural support, substrate orientation, ion coordination, and allosteric regulation.

Trehalose synthase ( Mycobacterium sp.),3ZO9,A,R200,Coordinates a chloride ion for allosteric regulation and conformational switching.,"caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6",literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The structural studies of Mycobacterium sp. Trehalose synthase (TreS) from PDB entry 3ZO9 chain A reveal that several residues, primarily located in or adjacent to key loop regions and ion‐binding sites, are involved in allosteric regulation and conformational switching.

One of the major players is Arg228. This residue is part of a chloride‐binding site located approximately 8 Å from the catalytic center. In TreS, Arg228 is proposed to coordinate a chloride ion in a manner analogous to the allosterically activating chloride site in human α‐amylases. Its strategic position near loops L1 and L7 suggests that chloride binding here may induce conformational changes that regulate substrate accessibility and enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Loop L7 (residues 338–384) is another critical determinant of conformational states. Within this loop, Leu344 is highlighted as a key residue because its side chain projects into the catalytic site, where it sterically clashes with the nucleophilic Asp230. This clash forces Asp230 to adopt an unusual side chain conformation—with its χ1 torsional angle rotated by roughly 90° compared to related GH13 enzymes—which is indicative of a switch between active and inactive forms of the enzyme. Thus, Leu344 indirectly controls catalysis by modulating the positioning of Asp230 (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Correspondingly, Asp230 itself plays a dual role. While it is the catalytic nucleophile involved in the double-displacement reaction converting maltose to trehalose, its novel “flipped” side-chain conformation observed in the inactive state serves as a marker for conformational switching. In this altered state, Asp230 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp128 on an adjacent β-strand. This interaction is unprecedented in other GH13 enzymes and appears to stabilize the inactive conformation, suggesting that the interplay between Asp230 and Asp128 is a key element in the enzyme’s regulatory mechanism (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Additional residues contribute via the stabilization of metal ion binding, which in turn affects overall conformational integrity. For instance, the hepta-coordinated calcium ion—situated near the interface between domains A and B—is coordinated by residues Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, and Glu237, along with water molecules. Although their primary role is to maintain structural rigidity, they likely contribute indirectly to conformational switching by stabilizing distinct enzyme states (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Similarly, the hexa-coordinated magnesium ion in a solvent-exposed loop L1 (residues 50–60) is coordinated by Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, Asp59, and one water molecule. This magnesium site is homologous to a corresponding ion-binding site in trehalulose synthase MutB and may influence local loop conformations that contribute to allosteric behavior (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Finally, additional chloride ion-binding sites involving residues from extended loops—particularly in loop L7 where residues such as Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, and Arg375 help coordinate a secondary chloride ion—are implicated in modulating conformational dynamics. These sites likely operate in tandem with the primary chloride site centered on Arg228 to facilitate allosteric regulation of substrate access and overall enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

In summary, residues Arg228, Leu344, Asp230, and Asp128 emerge as central to the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in TreS, while metal ion-coordinating residues from both the calcium and magnesium sites—namely Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, Glu237, Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, and Asp59—as well as secondary chloride-coordinating residues in loop L7 (Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, Arg375), contribute to stabilizing distinct conformational states. The evidence for these roles is derived primarily from crystallographic comparisons and ligand/inhibitor binding studies, as reported by Caner et al. (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7)."

For instance, the hepta-coordinated calcium ion—situated near the interface between domains A and B—is coordinated by residues Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, and Glu237, along with water molecules. Although their primary role is to maintain structural rigidity, they likely contribute indirectly to conformational switching by stabilizing distinct enzyme states (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Similarly, the hexa-coordinated magnesium ion in a solvent-exposed loop L1 (residues 50–60) is coordinated by Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, Asp59, and one water molecule. This magnesium site is homologous to a corresponding ion-binding site in trehalulose synthase MutB and may influence local loop conformations that contribute to allosteric behavior (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Finally, additional chloride ion-binding sites involving residues from extended loops—particularly in loop L7 where residues such as Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, and Arg375 help coordinate a secondary chloride ion—are implicated in modulating conformational dynamics. These sites likely operate in tandem with the primary chloride site centered on Arg228 to facilitate allosteric regulation of substrate access and overall enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

In summary, residues Arg228, Leu344, Asp230, and Asp128 emerge as central to the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in TreS, while metal ion-coordinating residues from both the calcium and magnesium sites—namely Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, Glu237, Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, and Asp59—as well as secondary chloride-coordinating residues in loop L7 (Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, Arg375), contribute to stabilizing distinct conformational states. The evidence for these roles is derived primarily from crystallographic comparisons and ligand/inhibitor binding studies, as reported by Caner et al.

Trehalose synthase (TreS) from PDB entry 3ZO9 chain A reveal that several residues, primarily located in or adjacent to key loop regions and ion‐binding sites, are involved in allosteric regulation and conformational switching.

One of the major players is Arg228. This residue is part of a chloride‐binding site located approximately 8 Å from the catalytic center. In TreS, Arg228 is proposed to coordinate a chloride ion in a manner analogous to the allosterically activating chloride site in human α‐amylases. Its strategic position near loops L1 and L7 suggests that chloride binding here may induce conformational changes that regulate substrate accessibility and enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Loop L7 (residues 338–384) is another critical determinant of conformational states. Within this loop, Leu344 is highlighted as a key residue because its side chain projects into the catalytic site, where it sterically clashes with the nucleophilic Asp230. This clash forces Asp230 to adopt an unusual side chain conformation—with its χ1 torsional angle rotated by roughly 90° compared to related GH13 enzymes—which is indicative of a switch between active and inactive forms of the enzyme. Thus, Leu344 indirectly controls catalysis by modulating the positioning of Asp230 (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Correspondingly, Asp230 itself plays a dual role. While it is the catalytic nucleophile involved in the double-displacement reaction converting maltose to trehalose, its novel “flipped” side-chain conformation observed in the inactive state serves as a marker for conformational switching. In this altered state, Asp230 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp128 on an adjacent β-strand. This interaction is unprecedented in other GH13 enzymes and appears to stabilize the inactive conformation, suggesting that the interplay between Asp230 and Asp128 is a key element in the enzyme’s regulatory mechanism (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

While it is the catalytic nucleophile involved in the double-displacement reaction converting maltose to trehalose, its novel “flipped” side-chain conformation observed in the inactive state serves as a marker for conformational switching. In this altered state, Asp230 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp128 on an adjacent β-strand. This interaction is unprecedented in other GH13 enzymes and appears to stabilize the inactive conformation, suggesting that the interplay between Asp230 and Asp128 is a key element in the enzyme’s regulatory mechanism (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Additional residues contribute via the stabilization of metal ion binding, which in turn affects overall conformational integrity. For instance, the hepta-coordinated calcium ion—situated near the interface between domains A and B—is coordinated by residues Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, and Glu237, along with water molecules. Although their primary role is to maintain structural rigidity, they likely contribute indirectly to conformational switching by stabilizing distinct enzyme states (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Similarly, the hexa-coordinated magnesium ion in a solvent-exposed loop L1 (residues 50–60) is coordinated by Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, Asp59, and one water molecule. This magnesium site is homologous to a corresponding ion-binding site in trehalulose synthase MutB and may influence local loop conformations that contribute to allosteric behavior (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Finally, additional chloride ion-binding sites involving residues from extended loops—particularly in loop L7 where residues such as Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, and Arg375 help coordinate a secondary chloride ion—are implicated in modulating conformational dynamics. These sites likely operate in tandem with the primary chloride site centered on Arg228 to facilitate allosteric regulation of substrate access and overall enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

In summary, residues Arg228, Leu344, Asp230, and Asp128 emerge as central to the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in TreS, while metal ion-coordinating residues from both the calcium and magnesium sites—namely Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, Glu237, Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, and Asp59—as well as secondary chloride-coordinating residues in loop L7 (Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, Arg375), contribute to stabilizing distinct conformational states.

Within this loop, Leu344 is highlighted as a key residue because its side chain projects into the catalytic site, where it sterically clashes with the nucleophilic Asp230. This clash forces Asp230 to adopt an unusual side chain conformation—with its χ1 torsional angle rotated by roughly 90° compared to related GH13 enzymes—which is indicative of a switch between active and inactive forms of the enzyme. Thus, Leu344 indirectly controls catalysis by modulating the positioning of Asp230 (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Correspondingly, Asp230 itself plays a dual role. While it is the catalytic nucleophile involved in the double-displacement reaction converting maltose to trehalose, its novel “flipped” side-chain conformation observed in the inactive state serves as a marker for conformational switching. In this altered state, Asp230 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp128 on an adjacent β-strand. This interaction is unprecedented in other GH13 enzymes and appears to stabilize the inactive conformation, suggesting that the interplay between Asp230 and Asp128 is a key element in the enzyme’s regulatory mechanism (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

Additional residues contribute via the stabilization of metal ion binding, which in turn affects overall conformational integrity. For instance, the hepta-coordinated calcium ion—situated near the interface between domains A and B—is coordinated by residues Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, and Glu237, along with water molecules. Although their primary role is to maintain structural rigidity, they likely contribute indirectly to conformational switching by stabilizing distinct enzyme states (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Similarly, the hexa-coordinated magnesium ion in a solvent-exposed loop L1 (residues 50–60) is coordinated by Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, Asp59, and one water molecule. This magnesium site is homologous to a corresponding ion-binding site in trehalulose synthase MutB and may influence local loop conformations that contribute to allosteric behavior (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Finally, additional chloride ion-binding sites involving residues from extended loops—particularly in loop L7 where residues such as Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, and Arg375 help coordinate a secondary chloride ion—are implicated in modulating conformational dynamics. These sites likely operate in tandem with the primary chloride site centered on Arg228 to facilitate allosteric regulation of substrate access and overall enzyme activity (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

In summary, residues Arg228, Leu344, Asp230, and Asp128 emerge as central to the allosteric regulation and conformational switching in TreS, while metal ion-coordinating residues from both the calcium and magnesium sites—namely Asn132, Asp200, Tyr234, Leu235, Glu237, Asp51, Asn53, Asp55, Ile57, and Asp59—as well as secondary chloride-coordinating residues in loop L7 (Arg339, Glu343, His341, Arg374, Arg375), contribute to stabilizing distinct conformational states.

First and foremost, the catalytic center of TreS is built around a conserved triad of carboxylic acid‐containing residues. Asp230 functions as the catalytic nucleophile, attacking the anomeric carbon of the substrate; notably, its side chain adopts an unusual 90°‐rotated conformation compared to other GH13 enzymes, which likely influences the enzyme’s substrate positioning and specificity (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5). Glu272 serves as the acid/base catalyst necessary for proton transfer during catalysis (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5), while Asp342 not only helps in substrate binding directly but also is embedded in the extended loop L7 that is unique to TreS (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Adjacent to the catalytic triad, Arg228 plays a dual role. It is positioned near Asp230 and is involved in coordinating chloride ions. The chloride ion binding, mediated by Arg228, is essential for the proper configuration of the active site and thus contributes indirectly but crucially to substrate binding and specificity (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

A critical structural feature that modulates substrate access is the unusual loop L7 (residues 338–384). Within this loop, Leu344 has been highlighted as particularly important because its side chain sterically interferes with the −1 subsite by displacing Asp230’s side chain. This “blocking” effect suggests that Leu344 helps define the narrow geometry of the active site pocket and thereby directly influences substrate specificity by preventing conventional substrate binding seen in related enzymes (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Additional residues that participate in the overall geometry and stabilization of the active site come from coordination of chloride ions. In particular, residues Glu343, Arg339, His341, Arg374, Arg375, along with Arg47 and Leu46, are involved in forming binding sites for chloride ions. Although these residues are not directly forming hydrogen bonds to the substrate, their role in maintaining the proper conformation of active site loops is critical for ligand binding (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

There are further contributions from conserved aromatic residues that are positioned in homologous roles by comparison with related enzymes. Tyr93 and Phe194, which are also implicated as part of the oligomerization interface, are suggested to participate in stacking interactions with sugar moieties. Their presence supports substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions and helps stabilize the substrate in the correct orientation for catalysis. A homologous role is attributed to Arg421, which in MutB and similar enzymes is known to assist in substrate positioning and electrostatic stabilization (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

While studies on related enzymes (for example, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis TreS, where residues such as Asp238, Glu280, and Asp350 are critical) provide corroborating evidence that a similar set of catalytic residues and active site features govern substrate binding, the detailed structural characterization provided by Caner et al. establishes that in the M. smegmatis enzyme (PDB 3ZO9 chain A) the combined effects of the catalytic triad (Asp230, Glu272, Asp342), the nearby Arg228, as well as the modulatory effects of Leu344 and the chloride ion-coordinating residues, define the unique ligand and substrate specificity profile of this enzyme (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Glu272 serves as the acid/base catalyst necessary for proton transfer during catalysis (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5), while Asp342 not only helps in substrate binding directly but also is embedded in the extended loop L7 that is unique to TreS (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Adjacent to the catalytic triad, Arg228 plays a dual role. It is positioned near Asp230 and is involved in coordinating chloride ions. The chloride ion binding, mediated by Arg228, is essential for the proper configuration of the active site and thus contributes indirectly but crucially to substrate binding and specificity (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

A critical structural feature that modulates substrate access is the unusual loop L7 (residues 338–384). Within this loop, Leu344 has been highlighted as particularly important because its side chain sterically interferes with the −1 subsite by displacing Asp230’s side chain. This “blocking” effect suggests that Leu344 helps define the narrow geometry of the active site pocket and thereby directly influences substrate specificity by preventing conventional substrate binding seen in related enzymes (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Additional residues that participate in the overall geometry and stabilization of the active site come from coordination of chloride ions. In particular, residues Glu343, Arg339, His341, Arg374, Arg375, along with Arg47 and Leu46, are involved in forming binding sites for chloride ions. Although these residues are not directly forming hydrogen bonds to the substrate, their role in maintaining the proper conformation of active site loops is critical for ligand binding (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

There are further contributions from conserved aromatic residues that are positioned in homologous roles by comparison with related enzymes. Tyr93 and Phe194, which are also implicated as part of the oligomerization interface, are suggested to participate in stacking interactions with sugar moieties. Their presence supports substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions and helps stabilize the substrate in the correct orientation for catalysis. A homologous role is attributed to Arg421, which in MutB and similar enzymes is known to assist in substrate positioning and electrostatic stabilization (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

While studies on related enzymes (for example, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis TreS, where residues such as Asp238, Glu280, and Asp350 are critical) provide corroborating evidence that a similar set of catalytic residues and active site features govern substrate binding, the detailed structural characterization provided by Caner et al. establishes that in the M. smegmatis enzyme (PDB 3ZO9 chain A) the combined effects of the catalytic triad (Asp230, Glu272, Asp342), the nearby Arg228, as well as the modulatory effects of Leu344 and the chloride ion-coordinating residues, define the unique ligand and substrate specificity profile of this enzyme (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Overall, the evidence indicates that substrate specificity in TreS is achieved by a precisely arranged active site pocket. The catalytic triad directly engages in the chemical transformation, whereas nearby residues (Arg228, Leu344, Glu343, Arg339, His341, Arg374, Arg375, Arg47, Leu46, Tyr93, Phe194, and Arg421) work in concert—through direct interactions or by stabilizing the catalytic conformation—to fine-tune substrate binding (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7)."

This “blocking” effect suggests that Leu344 helps define the narrow geometry of the active site pocket and thereby directly influences substrate specificity by preventing conventional substrate binding seen in related enzymes (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Additional residues that participate in the overall geometry and stabilization of the active site come from coordination of chloride ions. In particular, residues Glu343, Arg339, His341, Arg374, Arg375, along with Arg47 and Leu46, are involved in forming binding sites for chloride ions. Although these residues are not directly forming hydrogen bonds to the substrate, their role in maintaining the proper conformation of active site loops is critical for ligand binding (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

There are further contributions from conserved aromatic residues that are positioned in homologous roles by comparison with related enzymes. Tyr93 and Phe194, which are also implicated as part of the oligomerization interface, are suggested to participate in stacking interactions with sugar moieties. Their presence supports substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions and helps stabilize the substrate in the correct orientation for catalysis. A homologous role is attributed to Arg421, which in MutB and similar enzymes is known to assist in substrate positioning and electrostatic stabilization (caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

While studies on related enzymes (for example, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis TreS, where residues such as Asp238, Glu280, and Asp350 are critical) provide corroborating evidence that a similar set of catalytic residues and active site features govern substrate binding, the detailed structural characterization provided by Caner et al. establishes that in the M. smegmatis enzyme (PDB 3ZO9 chain A) the combined effects of the catalytic triad (Asp230, Glu272, Asp342), the nearby Arg228, as well as the modulatory effects of Leu344 and the chloride ion-coordinating residues, define the unique ligand and substrate specificity profile of this enzyme (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Overall, the evidence indicates that substrate specificity in TreS is achieved by a precisely arranged active site pocket. The catalytic triad directly engages in the chemical transformation, whereas nearby residues (Arg228, Leu344, Glu343, Arg339, His341, Arg374, Arg375, Arg47, Leu46, Tyr93, Phe194, and Arg421) work in concert—through direct interactions or by stabilizing the catalytic conformation—to fine-tune substrate binding (caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7)."

1. Asp230, Glu272, and Asp342 (Catalytic Triad)  
Asp230 acts as the catalytic nucleophile that initiates the formation of a covalent β-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Glu272 functions as the general acid/base, facilitating proton transfer during bond cleavage and reformation. Asp342, found in the active site loop, plays an essential role in substrate binding, in part by coordinating critical chloride ions that contribute to the active site architecture. These three carboxylic acid residues are conserved among GH13 family enzymes, and their roles have been documented through structural comparisons and functional assays that underline their indispensability for catalysis (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

2. Leu344 (Active Site Loop Modulator)  
Leu344 is located within the extended loop L7 (residues 338–384). Sequence alignments have highlighted this residue as particularly conserved and suggest a dual role. Structurally, Leu344 is positioned such that its side chain intrudes into the active site, where it can sterically influence substrate and inhibitor (acarbose) access. In the inactive form of the enzyme, Leu344 appears to hinder productive binding, suggesting that precise loop conformation is essential for switching between active and inactive states. Its conservation points to its importance in fine-tuning the active site geometry (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

3. Arg228 (Chloride Ion Coordination)  
Arg228 is directly involved in coordinating a chloride ion – a feature that is homologous to the allosteric chloride site found in human α-amylases. The chloride-binding event near the catalytic center is thought to contribute not only to fine‐tuning the active site electrostatics but also to overall enzyme stability. This residue, along with its accompanying backbone amides (including residues such as Glu343 and Arg339, as reported), is conserved and underscores the role of metal and halide ion coordination in maintaining a structurally robust active site (Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

4. Tyr93, Phe194, and Arg421 (Substrate Binding and Oligomerization)  
Beyond the core catalytic triad, additional conserved residues such as Tyr93 and Phe194 have been identified. These aromatic residues populate regions that are analogous to substrate-binding pockets in related enzymes (e.g., MutB) and also contribute to the oligomerization interface, which underlies the enzyme’s tetrameric assembly. Arg421, another highly conserved residue, participates in critical hydrogen bonding networks that help maintain structural integrity. Their conservation across homologues suggests roles both in ligand recognition and in stabilizing the overall quaternary structure of TreS (Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

5. Asp128 (Structural Tuning of the Active Site)  
Although less emphasized than the classical catalytic triad, Asp128 has been shown to interact with the unusually flipped side chain of Asp230. This hydrogen-bonding arrangement may represent an adaptation unique to this family of TreS enzymes, further supporting the notion that even subtle changes in residue interactions are evolutionarily conserved to maintain proper active site configuration and enzyme function (Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

In summary, evidence from high-resolution crystallographic studies and sequence alignments consistently indicates that Asp230, Glu272, and Asp342 constitute the catalytic core, while Leu344 modulates active site accessibility. Conserved residues such as Arg228, Tyr93, Phe194, Arg421, and even Asp128 help stabilize the active conformation through ion coordination, substrate binding, and oligomerization. Their conservation across homologues strongly supports their dual roles in catalytic efficiency and structural stability (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7)."

Arg421, another highly conserved residue, participates in critical hydrogen bonding networks that help maintain structural integrity. Their conservation across homologues suggests roles both in ligand recognition and in stabilizing the overall quaternary structure of TreS (Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

5. Asp128 (Structural Tuning of the Active Site)  
Although less emphasized than the classical catalytic triad, Asp128 has been shown to interact with the unusually flipped side chain of Asp230. This hydrogen-bonding arrangement may represent an adaptation unique to this family of TreS enzymes, further supporting the notion that even subtle changes in residue interactions are evolutionarily conserved to maintain proper active site configuration and enzyme function (Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

In summary, evidence from high-resolution crystallographic studies and sequence alignments consistently indicates that Asp230, Glu272, and Asp342 constitute the catalytic core, while Leu344 modulates active site accessibility. Conserved residues such as Arg228, Tyr93, Phe194, Arg421, and even Asp128 help stabilize the active conformation through ion coordination, substrate binding, and oligomerization. Their conservation across homologues strongly supports their dual roles in catalytic efficiency and structural stability (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7)."

1. Asp230, Glu272, and Asp342 (Catalytic Triad)  
Asp230 acts as the catalytic nucleophile that initiates the formation of a covalent β-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Glu272 functions as the general acid/base, facilitating proton transfer during bond cleavage and reformation. Asp342, found in the active site loop, plays an essential role in substrate binding, in part by coordinating critical chloride ions that contribute to the active site architecture. These three carboxylic acid residues are conserved among GH13 family enzymes, and their roles have been documented through structural comparisons and functional assays that underline their indispensability for catalysis (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5).

Leu344 is located within the extended loop L7 (residues 338–384). Sequence alignments have highlighted this residue as particularly conserved and suggest a dual role. Structurally, Leu344 is positioned such that its side chain intrudes into the active site, where it can sterically influence substrate and inhibitor (acarbose) access. In the inactive form of the enzyme, Leu344 appears to hinder productive binding, suggesting that precise loop conformation is essential for switching between active and inactive states. Its conservation points to its importance in fine-tuning the active site geometry (Caner2013thestructureof pages 2-4, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6, Caner2013thestructureof pages 6-7).

The chloride-binding event near the catalytic center is thought to contribute not only to fine‐tuning the active site electrostatics but also to overall enzyme stability. This residue, along with its accompanying backbone amides (including residues such as Glu343 and Arg339, as reported), is conserved and underscores the role of metal and halide ion coordination in maintaining a structurally robust active site (Caner2013thestructureof pages 4-5, Caner2013thestructureof pages 5-6).

Subtilisin Carlsberg ( B. licheniformis ),1SBC,A,T114,Determines S4 pocket binding specificity via hydrogen bonding networks.,"hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4",literature,,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"Subtilisin Carlsberg’s ability to bind substrates and inhibitors arises from a spatially discrete cluster of residues that together create well‐defined binding pockets (usually referred to as the S1 to S4 subsites) around its catalytic center. Multiple studies using geometric analysis and crystallographic comparisons have identified several key residues that mediate substrate recognition and specificity in the B. licheniformis enzyme structure (PDB 1SBC chain A).

One major group comprises the catalytic triad, where His64 and Ser221 are central. His64 is not only a catalytic residue but also helps stabilize the active‐site conformation, a function that is further reinforced by its involvement in a nearby Ca2+ binding loop that stabilizes the overall structure (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, mcphalen1991calciumbindingsitesin pages 16-20). Although Asp32 is classically part of the triad in subtilisins, the context provided here primarily emphasizes His64 and Ser221 for their dual role in catalysis and in mediating substrate binding via proper active‐site architecture.

In addition to the catalytic residues, the S1 pocket is crucial for accommodating the primary specificity-determining residue of the substrate. Here, Ser125 and Leu126 have been repeatedly identified as forming one of the key components. Ser125 (through its backbone atoms) and Leu126 contribute directly by providing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and hydrophobic interactions respectively that help anchor the substrate in the correct orientation (peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 3-4, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). Similarly, for the S3 pocket, Gly100 appears to be important. Its small side chain permits close atomic contacts with the substrate’s side chain, allowing a snug fit and facilitating appropriate positioning (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 3-4).

For the S4 pocket, Thr220 is mentioned as a determinant of binding specificity. Its polar side chain often contributes to hydrogen bonding networks that help stabilize the engagement of distal substrate residues, while the geometry of the pocket also benefits from contributions of adjoining residues (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). In some analyses, residue Ser221 is implicated not only in catalysis as part of the triad but also in forming part of the substrate-binding interface—an example of overlapping structural roles that are common in such enzymes.

Additional residues identified by geometric approaches include a set of smaller residues—such as Gly127, Gly128, Gly154, and an adjacent Asn155—as these form part of the extended binding environment, shaping the pockets by providing both backbone and side-chain contacts that fine-tune binding specificity. For example, Gly154, Ala152, and Asn155 appear to contribute to the S1/S2 regions by defining the pocket boundaries and allowing necessary flexibility (peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). Hydrophobic residues like Leu96 and Leu217 further contribute by creating a nonpolar “wall” that assists in substrate recognition through van der Waals interactions (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5).

Finally, several polar and charged residues (for instance, Asn218, Glu195-197, Arg247, Lys170, Lys265, Tyr171, Asp172, and Val174) provide additional contacts that stabilize ligand binding via hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions. These residues seem to contribute less directly than those forming the classical pockets but are integral in fine-tuning the binding energy and specificity of the enzyme (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4).

In summary, the binding and specificity in Subtilisin Carlsberg (PDB 1SBC chain A) are mediated by a constellation of residues that includes the catalytic His64 and Ser221, the S1 pocket residues Ser125 and Leu126, S3 and S4 contributors such as Gly100 and Thr220, and additional pocket‐defining residues Gly127, Gly128, Gly154, Ala152, Asn155 along with supportive hydrophobic and polar side chains (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 3-4, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4, mcphalen1991calciumbindingsitesin pages 16-20)."

Multiple studies using geometric analysis and crystallographic comparisons have identified several key residues that mediate substrate recognition and specificity in the B. licheniformis enzyme structure (PDB 1SBC chain A).

One major group comprises the catalytic triad, where His64 and Ser221 are central. His64 is not only a catalytic residue but also helps stabilize the active‐site conformation, a function that is further reinforced by its involvement in a nearby Ca2+ binding loop that stabilizes the overall structure (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, mcphalen1991calciumbindingsitesin pages 16-20). Although Asp32 is classically part of the triad in subtilisins, the context provided here primarily emphasizes His64 and Ser221 for their dual role in catalysis and in mediating substrate binding via proper active‐site architecture.

In addition to the catalytic residues, the S1 pocket is crucial for accommodating the primary specificity-determining residue of the substrate. Here, Ser125 and Leu126 have been repeatedly identified as forming one of the key components. Ser125 (through its backbone atoms) and Leu126 contribute directly by providing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and hydrophobic interactions respectively that help anchor the substrate in the correct orientation (peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 3-4, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). Similarly, for the S3 pocket, Gly100 appears to be important. Its small side chain permits close atomic contacts with the substrate’s side chain, allowing a snug fit and facilitating appropriate positioning (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 3-4).

For the S4 pocket, Thr220 is mentioned as a determinant of binding specificity. Its polar side chain often contributes to hydrogen bonding networks that help stabilize the engagement of distal substrate residues, while the geometry of the pocket also benefits from contributions of adjoining residues (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5, peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). In some analyses, residue Ser221 is implicated not only in catalysis as part of the triad but also in forming part of the substrate-binding interface—an example of overlapping structural roles that are common in such enzymes.

Additional residues identified by geometric approaches include a set of smaller residues—such as Gly127, Gly128, Gly154, and an adjacent Asn155—as these form part of the extended binding environment, shaping the pockets by providing both backbone and side-chain contacts that fine-tune binding specificity. For example, Gly154, Ala152, and Asn155 appear to contribute to the S1/S2 regions by defining the pocket boundaries and allowing necessary flexibility (peters1996theautomaticsearch pages 4-4). Hydrophobic residues like Leu96 and Leu217 further contribute by creating a nonpolar “wall” that assists in substrate recognition through van der Waals interactions (hoppe2003needlehaystackaprogram pages 4-5).

Finally, several polar and charged residues (for instance, Asn218, Glu195-197, Arg247, Lys170, Lys265, Tyr171, Asp172, and Val174) provide additional contacts that stabilize ligand binding via hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions.

Key residues and groups include:

1. K13 and R249 – In one study employing B‐factor analysis to identify flexible sites, site‐directed mutagenesis was used to substitute several high B‐factor residues. Among the mutants, K13L and R249L showed markedly improved thermal stability. In particular, the R249L mutation not only increased the enzyme’s melting temperature by about 2°C but also doubled residual activity at elevated temperatures (50–60°C) compared to wild type. These findings strongly indicate that the flexible side chains at positions 13 and 249 contribute to structural instability under heat stress, and substituting them with leucine reduces local flexibility and enhances thermostability (kim2010developmentofthermostable pages 2-3, kim2010developmentofthermostable pages 5-5).

2. A162 and K308 – Several studies have targeted disulfide bridge engineering as a rational strategy for thermostabilization. Computational approaches identified a residue pair with a high combined B-factor (sum = 25.16), suggesting it is a highly flexible hotspot. The subsequent introduction of cysteines at positions 162 and 308 (A162C–K308C) enabled the formation of a disulfide bond that rigidified the region, leading to significant improvements in half-life at 50°C as well as increases in Tm. This intervention exemplifies how reinforcing structural contacts can substantially stabilize CALB (le2012developmentofthermostable pages 3-5, guan2020directedevolutionof pages 7-9).

3. Additional engineered disulfide pairs – Other candidate residue pairs such as N169–F304 and Q156–L163 were also evaluated using similar strategies. Although improvements in stability were observed, these variants were less effective than the A162–K308 pair, yet their inclusion reinforces the concept that residues in these loop or turn regions are critical for overall conformational rigidity (le2012developmentofthermostable pages 3-5, le2012developmentofthermostable pages 9-10).

4. A251 – An independent computational and experimental study examined point mutations predicted to enhance intramolecular interactions. In this work, the A251E mutation was found to increase the thermal half-life at 50°C to 251 minutes (from 100 minutes for wild type), evidencing that a substitution at residue 251, likely by introducing an additional charge or hydrogen bonding network, can stabilize the protein under thermal stress (park2014computationalapproachfor pages 4-5).

5. Thr103 – A mutation within the region surrounding the active serine (T103G) demonstrated that even residues adjacent to the catalytic site can influence thermostability. Here, replacing Thr103 increased the time the enzyme remained active at 60°C (from 6 minutes to 25 minutes), suggesting that this residue plays a role in maintaining a stable local structure around the active site, which in turn affects overall thermal performance (szczesnaantczak2014coldactiveyeastlipases pages 3-6).

6. Surface polar residues (N97, N264, D265) – In a design strategy targeting enzyme stability in hydrophilic organic solvents, mutations such as N97Q, N264Q, and D265E were shown to enhance enzyme half-life in methanol. Although the study focused on solvent rather than pure thermal stability, these surface residues likely affect the hydrogen bonding network that can also contribute indirectly to thermostability (park2012stabilizationofcandida pages 6-7).

7. Helix 10 residues (I280 and I287) – Chimeric enzymes produced via DNA family shuffling identified changes in helix 10 as key determinants of thermostability. In particular, substitutions Ile280Leu and Ile287Leu in the chimeric clone resulted in higher Tm and extended half-life, underscoring the role of this secondary structural element in maintaining an optimal thermo‐stable conformation (suen2004improvedactivityand pages 6-7).

In summary, residues that dramatically affect CALB thermostability include K13, R249, A162, K308, A251, and Thr103, with additional contributions from surface residues (N97, N264, D265) and helix 10 positions (I280, I287).

Lipase B ( Candida antarctica ),1TCA,A,G254,Residue in α10 helix contributing to active site cleft regulation.,turunen2016singleenzymekineticswith pages 47-49,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available evidence indicates that the primary determinants of allosteric regulation and conformational switching in Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB, pdb 1TCA chain A) are not localized to a distant “allosteric site” but are inherent to its mobile secondary structure elements. In particular, multiple independent studies converge on the notion that the flexible helices in the protein—especially the α5 and, to a lesser degree, the α10 helix—play central roles in modulating active site accessibility via dynamic conformational changes.

The α5 helix has been repeatedly implicated as a key regulatory element acting as a “lid” whose position governs the width of the active site cleft. Turunen (turunen2016singleenzymekineticswith pages 47-49) identifies residues within the α5 helix (specifically residues 142–146) as being critical for this role. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in this study reveal that the dominant motion controlling active site exposure is the movement of the α5 helix over the catalytic pocket. This motion leads to partitioning of conformations into closed, crystal-like, and open states, with open conformations corresponding to a wider cleft that favors binding of bulkier substrates. Subsequently, Turunen (turunen2016singleenzymekineticswith pages 42-44) further emphasizes that the dynamic behavior of the α5 helix is the major factor regulating substrate access, essentially therefore defining its allosteric function by shifting the equilibrium between active (open) and inactive (closed) enzyme states.

Complementary evidence is provided by Johnson (johnson2015elucidationofconformational pages 41-46) who documents that the α5 helix (spanning approximately residues 126–147 in his analysis) exhibits one of the highest local flexibilities (as evidenced by high B-factors) in various solvent conditions. This high flexibility correlates with gating motions that transition the access channel from closed to open configurations. In addition, Johnson (johnson2015elucidationofconformational pages 94-102) leverages principal component analysis of dynamic residue-residue contacts to highlight the importance of specific glycine residues within the α5 helix. Although his work on a lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) identified Gly127 and Gly133 as key players, it suggests that structurally analogous glycine residues in CALB’s α5 region likely serve a similar function by facilitating intra-helical flexibility and the switching process.

The C-terminal part of the α10 helix (residues 278–287) is also recognized as contributing to the dynamic regulation. Turunen (turunen2016singleenzymekineticswith pages 47-49) notes that this region, while less flexible than the α5 helix, forms part of the active site cleft. Its conformation influences the overall cleft distance and, by extension, substrate binding and enzyme activity. This interplay between α5 and α10 regions underscores a coordinated regulation mechanism where the relative motions of these helices modulate the structural state of the active site cleft.

Finally, the study by Xie (xie2023coevolutionbasedpredictionof pages 10-11) employing coevolution‐based methods (KeyAlloSite) supports that residues outside of the classical substrate-binding region—including those in the dynamic helices—are predicted to be key allosteric regulators.

One group corresponds to the core catalytic machinery, and the other comprises residues shaping the binding pocket and modulating access.

Firstly, the catalytic triad of Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) forms the central component of substrate recognition. In 1TCA chain A, the triad is composed of Ser105, His224, and Asp187. Ser105 functions as the nucleophile that attacks the ester bond of the substrate, directly engaging the ligand during catalysis. His224 plays the role of a general base, facilitating proton transfer to promote the formation and collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate. Asp187, in turn, stabilizes His224 throughout the catalytic cycle, ensuring the proper orientation and electronic environment necessary for substrate processing (rotticci2000understandingandengineering pages 30-35, rayani2023stabilisationoflowa pages 29-35). In addition to these triad members, the oxyanion hole—formed primarily by the backbone NH of Gly106 and polar contributions from Thr40—stabilizes the negative charge emerging on the substrate’s carbonyl oxygen during the transition state. This network of hydrogen bonds significantly lowers the activation barrier and contributes indirectly to specificity by favoring proper substrate alignment (rotticci2000understandingandengineering pages 30-35, svedendahl2009exploringconjugateaddition pages 10-15).

Beyond the catalytic residues, specific structural elements of CALB define the substrate binding pocket and confer selectivity. The enzyme’s active site is embedded within a funnel‐shaped cavity whose architecture is determined by hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Hydrophobic interactions are critical for accommodating the acyl chains of lipid substrates. In particular, residues lining α-helix 5—such as Leu140, Ala141, and Leu144—create a hydrophilic–hydrophobic interface that directs the glycerol backbone of substrates into the active site. Similarly, residues in α-helix 10—including Leu278, Ala282, Ile285, and Leu287—form a hydrophobic “bed” that stabilizes fatty acid portions of the ligand, guiding them into the correct orientation for catalysis. These residues have been implicated in determining chain-length specificity and substrate access, as supported by crystallographic studies that reveal their close proximity (within van der Waals distance) to bound ligands (silvestrini2020principlesoflipid–enzyme pages 9-13, silvestrini2020principlesoflipid–enzyme pages 13-16).

Additionally, aromatic residues such as Trp104 contribute to the environment at the bottom of the binding pocket, likely through π-stacking interactions or by stabilizing hydrophobic contacts with the substrate. This residue helps define the size and shape of the pocket and thus influences which substrates can be optimally accommodated (svedendahl2009exploringconjugateaddition pages 10-15, li2009molecularmodelingof pages 1-2).

Moreover, computational studies highlighting the mobility of structural elements, particularly the α5 and α10 helices, have shown that conformational changes in these regions regulate substrate access. These dynamics help modulate exposure of the active site and create flexible binding sites that can accommodate substrates of different sizes while preserving enantioselectivity (turunen2016singleenzymekineticswith pages 47-49, zisis2015interfacialactivationof pages 1-2, ganjalikhany2012functionalmotionsof pages 10-11).

Lipase ( Thermomyces lanuginosus ),1DT3,A,D5,Residue in 25-loop; D27R mutation introduces salt bridge improving thermostability.,"xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 1-2, xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 4-6",literature,D26N;D26R,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The thermostability of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) in pdb 1DT3 chain A is influenced by several key residues. The evidence comes from both engineered mutations and observations of natural structural features that modulate unfolding thermodynamics, particularly the melting temperature (Tm) and ΔG° of unfolding.

One major set of residues identified is Isoleucine 86 and Isoleucine 255. In the wild‐type enzyme, these hydrophobic residues are positioned such that they contribute to the lid domain’s natural mobility and interfacial binding. However, when mutated to cysteines (I86C and I255C) to force the formation of an engineered disulfide bond (resulting in the TlL_locked variant), the lid is locked in a closed conformation that strains the secondary structure. This engineered bond causes a reduction in melting temperature by approximately 5°C, directly indicating an adverse effect on thermostability and a likely alteration in the ΔG° of unfolding. These residues, therefore, serve a dual role: in their native hydrophobic form they help anchor the lid for proper activity, whereas in a disulfide‐linked form they impose conformational restrictions that destabilize the overall fold (skjoldjørgensen2017controlledlidopeningin pages 15-20).

Another group of critical residues resides in the N-terminal “25-loop” region of TLL. In this stretch—from approximately residues 24 to 31—a combination of amino acids modulates regional flexibility, which in turn affects the overall stability of the enzyme. Site-directed substitution studies substituting residues such as Lysine 24, Aspartic acid 27, Proline 29, and Alanine 30 (via mutations K24S, D27N/D27R, P29S, and A30P) have shown significant impacts on thermostability. For instance, the A30P substitution increases the melting temperature by about 5.1°C relative to wild-type TLL, likely by imposing rigid constraints on the backbone through the cyclic structure of proline. Moreover, among the Asp27 variants, the D27R mutant introduces a new salt bridge between Arg27 and Glu56, which has been correlated with improvements in thermostability. These findings illustrate that alterations in the 25-loop not only modify the local flexibility (as evidenced by reduced B-factors and decreased RMSF in molecular dynamics simulations) but also enhance stability by promoting tighter hydrogen bonding and favorable electrostatic interactions (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 1-2, xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 4-6).

A further natural stabilizing feature of TLL is its intrinsic disulfide bonds. TLL naturally contains several disulfide bridges—specifically those linking Cysteine 22 to Cysteine 268, Cysteine 104 to Cysteine 107, and Cysteine 36 to Cysteine 41. These bonds are critical for maintaining the rigidity of the enzyme’s tertiary structure. They reduce the conformational entropy of the unfolded state and create a high kinetic barrier to unfolding, factors known to increase both the melting temperature and the ΔG° of unfolding. Experimental evidence from studies on protein–surfactant interactions has shown that reducing these disulfide bonds leads to a significant loss in kinetic stability, underscoring their role in preserving thermostability (andersen2009proteinsurfactantinteractionsthe pages 158-159, andersen2009proteinsurfactantinteractionsthe pages 162-164).

In addition, residues in the C-terminal region also contribute synergistically to thermostability. For example, evidence indicates that a conserved hydrogen bond between Aspartic acid 254 and Isoleucine 255 (beyond the engineered changes) helps restrict flexibility in the C-terminus. This interaction has been linked to a more stable folded state when combined with modifications at the N-terminus, suggesting that stabilization of terminal regions via hydrogen bonds and salt-bridge formation is an effective strategy for enhancing thermostability (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 6-9).

In summary, the thermostability of TLL from pdb 1DT3 chain A is modulated by:  

• I86 and I255, whose conversion to cysteines (to form an engineered disulfide bond) destabilizes the enzyme by locking the lid in a strained, closed conformation (skjoldjørgensen2017controlledlidopeningin pages 15-20).

• The 25-loop residues (K24, D27, P29, and A30), where substitutions (e.g., A30P, D27R) rigidify the loop and introduce new interactions such as salt bridges, thereby increasing the melting temperature and likely the ΔG° of unfolding (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 1-2, xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 4-6).

• The natural disulfide bonds (C22–C268, C104–C107, C36–C41), which are essential for maintaining the enzyme’s rigid tertiary structure and high kinetic/thermodynamic stability (andersen2009proteinsurfactantinteractionsthe pages 158-159, andersen2009proteinsurfactantinteractionsthe pages 162-164).

• Additional interactions at the C-terminal region such as the D254–I255 hydrogen bond further contribute to the overall stability by reducing flexibility in terminal segments (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 6-9).

Each of these residues or interactions has been directly implicated through structural analysis, mutagenesis experiments, thermal assays, and molecular dynamics simulations in influencing parameters such as the melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding, thereby modulating the thermostability of TLL."
Lipase ( Thermomyces lanuginosus ),1DT3,A,D5,Residue in the 25-loop; D27R mutation forms a stabilizing salt-bridge with Glu56.,xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 9-10,literature,D26N;D26R,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,"The available evidence indicates that the residues in the N‐terminal 25‐loop region of TLL (found in PDB 1DT3 chain A) are key mediators of conformational switching that can influence allosteric regulation. In particular, the loop spanning residues 24–30, which includes Lys24, Asp27, Pro29, and Ala30, has been experimentally targeted by site‐directed mutagenesis to modulate both flexibility and thermostability (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 2-4). Mutagenesis at these positions (for example, the K24S, D27N, D27R, P29S, and A30P variants) demonstrated that changes in these residues dictate the dynamic behavior of the 25‐loop and, by extension, the overall flexibility of regions that influence substrate access. This loop is especially noteworthy because it is spatially close to the lid domain (approximately 8.5 Å away), which is well known in other lipases to undergo structural rearrangements that allow substrate binding through an open/closed switching mechanism (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 9-10, nars2015dynamiquefonctionnelledes pages 31-34).

More specifically, the mutation D27R is significant because it not only alters the properties of the loop but also creates a new salt‐bridge between residue 27 (when arginine replaces aspartate) and Glu56. This interaction evidently stabilizes the enzyme by connecting different structural elements, which in turn can restrict unnecessary flexibility and assist in conformational switching that is often coupled to allosteric regulation (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 9-10). It is reasonable to consider that Glu56, although not in the 25‐loop, is functionally linked via this salt‐bridge and therefore participates indirectly in the allosteric regulation by anchoring the loop in a more stable configuration.

In addition, while the studies by Xiang et al. primarily emphasize the 25‐loop, comparisons drawn from other investigations (notably, those on the dynamic properties of lipases) underscore the importance of the lid domain in controlling substrate access via conformational transitions. In lipases such as Thermomyces lanuginosus, the lid domain typically comprises an amphiphilic α‐helical region that undergoes open/closed transitions. For example, analogous studies on Yarrowia lipolytica Lip2 and Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BCL) show that residues forming the lid (in TLL, this region is inferred to begin around residue S83 and extend through the α2 helix) are critical for interfacial activation and overall allosteric control (nars2015dynamiquefonctionnelledes pages 31-34, nars2015dynamiquefonctionnelledes pages 34-38). Although the precise residue numbers for the lid in PDB 1DT3 chain A are not explicitly defined in the provided texts, the established pattern in related lipases supports that similar residues in TLL’s lid likely contribute to conformational switching. Thus, while the 25‐loop mutations directly modulate rigidity and thermostability, the lid domain works in concert to regulate substrate accessibility via conformational switching.

In summary, the most compelling evidence from the provided context implicates the 25‐loop residues—namely Lys24, Asp27, Pro29, and Ala30—as critical for mediating structural dynamics and potential allosteric regulation in TLL. The formation of an additional salt‐bridge between a mutated Asp27 (as Arg) and Glu56 further supports the functional importance of these interactions. In parallel, although not exhaustively detailed, residues in the lid domain (starting around S83) are also likely contributors to conformational switching and allosteric control, as inferred from analogous lipase studies (xiang2023improvingthethermostability pages 9-10, nars2015dynamiquefonctionnelledes pages 31-34)."
Lipase ( Thermomyces lanuginosus ),1DT3,A,G59,Substitution affects substrate stabilization via hydrogen bonding.,fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9,literature,G81S,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,"Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) in PDB 1DT3 chain A uses a combination of dynamic lid residues and fixed binding‐cleft residues to mediate ligand/substrate binding and specificity.

A critical element is the lid domain, which spans approximately from Arg81 to Asp96. This region is responsible for “interfacial activation” by undergoing conformational changes that open the enzyme’s active site. In particular, Arg84—often referred to as the “arginine switch” found in the left hinge of the lid—has been highlighted by structural and mutagenesis studies as key to modulating lid movement and thus substrate access (shu2009aspergillusnigerlipase pages 7-8). The flexibility of the lid is central to exposing the hydrophobic region of the active site during binding, with experimental evidence showing that even targeted mutations affecting lid residues can alter enantioselectivity and catalytic efficiency (khan2017theliddomain pages 3-5, khan2017theliddomain pages 6-7).

In addition to the lid, several residues in the substrate binding cleft have been identified as pivotal for ligand positioning and specificity. Kumar et al. report that residues Ile86, Glu87, Trp89, Ile90, Leu93, Phe95, and Leu97 form a wall on one side of the binding cleft, while Val203, Pro207, Pro208, Phe211, Tyr213, and Ile259 form the opposing wall (kumar2015enhancementofstability pages 2-4). The distances between specific atoms on these opposing sides correlate with the degree of cleft openness, which directly influences substrate access. For example, Leu259 is implicated in ligand positioning, as its mutation to asparagine was predicted to allow additional hydrogen-bond stabilization with certain ligand oxygen atoms, thereby enhancing specificity for particular substrate adducts (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9).

Furthermore, Fuentes et al. also highlight Gly82 as a residue whose substitution (to serine, for instance) could tweak the stabilization of substrate intermediates. Changing the side-chain from a hydrogen (in glycine) to a hydroxymethyl group (in serine) introduces a potential for extra hydrogen-bond interactions with ligand atoms (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9). This indicates that even subtle alterations in binding pocket residues can have measurable effects on substrate orientation and stabilization during the catalytic cycle.

Other studies using structural superposition and molecular dynamics emphasize that the overall substrate specificity appears to be a result of the concerted contributions of the dynamic lid domain and the spatial arrangement of the binding cleft residues. The catalytic mechanism, while relying on the classical serine–histidine–aspartate triad (which is conserved among lipases), is finely tuned by these non-catalytic residues which shape the binding pocket geometry and control the entry and exit of substrates (bordes2010exploringtheconformational pages 3-4).

In summary, TLL’s ligand binding and specificity are mediated by two sets of critical residues: first, the dynamic lid residues (spanning Arg81–Asp96, with Arg84 particularly notable) that regulate access to the active site through conformational changes; and second, the binding cleft residues, including Ile86, Glu87, Trp89, Ile90, Leu93, Phe95, and Leu97 on one side and Val203, Pro207, Pro208, Phe211, Tyr213, and especially Leu259 on the other. Mutagenesis and computational studies provide strong evidence that alterations in these residues can modulate enzyme activity, specificity, and stability, underscoring their critical roles in the enzyme’s function (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9, kumar2015enhancementofstability pages 2-4, shu2009aspergillusnigerlipase pages 7-8, khan2017theliddomain pages 3-5, khan2017theliddomain pages 6-7, bordes2010exploringtheconformational pages 3-4)."

The flexibility of the lid is central to exposing the hydrophobic region of the active site during binding, with experimental evidence showing that even targeted mutations affecting lid residues can alter enantioselectivity and catalytic efficiency (khan2017theliddomain pages 3-5, khan2017theliddomain pages 6-7).

In addition to the lid, several residues in the substrate binding cleft have been identified as pivotal for ligand positioning and specificity. Kumar et al. report that residues Ile86, Glu87, Trp89, Ile90, Leu93, Phe95, and Leu97 form a wall on one side of the binding cleft, while Val203, Pro207, Pro208, Phe211, Tyr213, and Ile259 form the opposing wall (kumar2015enhancementofstability pages 2-4). The distances between specific atoms on these opposing sides correlate with the degree of cleft openness, which directly influences substrate access. For example, Leu259 is implicated in ligand positioning, as its mutation to asparagine was predicted to allow additional hydrogen-bond stabilization with certain ligand oxygen atoms, thereby enhancing specificity for particular substrate adducts (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9).

Furthermore, Fuentes et al. also highlight Gly82 as a residue whose substitution (to serine, for instance) could tweak the stabilization of substrate intermediates. Changing the side-chain from a hydrogen (in glycine) to a hydroxymethyl group (in serine) introduces a potential for extra hydrogen-bond interactions with ligand atoms (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9). This indicates that even subtle alterations in binding pocket residues can have measurable effects on substrate orientation and stabilization during the catalytic cycle.

Other studies using structural superposition and molecular dynamics emphasize that the overall substrate specificity appears to be a result of the concerted contributions of the dynamic lid domain and the spatial arrangement of the binding cleft residues. The catalytic mechanism, while relying on the classical serine–histidine–aspartate triad (which is conserved among lipases), is finely tuned by these non-catalytic residues which shape the binding pocket geometry and control the entry and exit of substrates (bordes2010exploringtheconformational pages 3-4).

In summary, TLL’s ligand binding and specificity are mediated by two sets of critical residues: first, the dynamic lid residues (spanning Arg81–Asp96, with Arg84 particularly notable) that regulate access to the active site through conformational changes; and second, the binding cleft residues, including Ile86, Glu87, Trp89, Ile90, Leu93, Phe95, and Leu97 on one side and Val203, Pro207, Pro208, Phe211, Tyr213, and especially Leu259 on the other. Mutagenesis and computational studies provide strong evidence that alterations in these residues can modulate enzyme activity, specificity, and stability, underscoring their critical roles in the enzyme’s function (fuentes2004specificityinlipases pages 8-9, kumar2015enhancementofstability pages 2-4, shu2009aspergillusnigerlipase pages 7-8, khan2017theliddomain pages 3-5, khan2017theliddomain pages 6-7, bordes2010exploringtheconformational pages 3-4)."
Cutinase LCC,4EB0,A,F90,"Mutation modulates hydrophobic interactions, stabilizing the folded state and increasing melting temperature.",mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 12-12,literature,F124L,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"Cutinase LCC (PDB 4EB0 chain A) displays thermostability that is modulated by several key residues. Experimental evidence shows that modifications at these sites can alter the melting temperature (Tm) and the unfolding free energy (ΔG°) of the enzyme. The main residues with such roles are detailed below.

Firstly, mutations at phenylalanine residues 125 and 243 have been demonstrated to affect the enzyme’s thermal properties. In one study, single substitutions at Phe125 (to leu) and Phe243 (to Ile) and the combined double mutant (F125L/F243I) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); these mutations altered the thermal unfolding profile and increased the melting temperature for certain variants. This suggests that these aromatic residues are critical for maintaining proper hydrophobic packing that stabilizes the folded state, thereby modulating the unfolding energetics (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 12-12).

Secondly, a conserved aromatic tryptophan residue, located just below the catalytic serine within the active site region, has been implicated in stability. Although its specific mutation was not detailed numerically, the study emphasized that aromatic and hydrophobic interactions surrounding the active site are important for maintaining thermostability. Its conservation in LCC, in contrast to PETase in which it is absent, indicates that such aromatic residues contribute to lowering the local structural fluctuations and supporting the overall folded structure (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4).

Another residue affecting thermostability is Tyr95. Mutagenesis studies on LC-cutinase, which is highly related to LCC, revealed that substitution of Tyr95 with alanine (Y95A) decreases the melting temperature by approximately 4.2°C, indicating destabilization due to the loss of the aromatic side chain and its hydrophobic contacts. Conversely, substitution with phenylalanine (Y95F) increased the Tm by roughly 8.6°C. This clear relationship between the chemical nature of the side chain at position 95 and the melting behavior supports the critical role of residue 95 in maintaining structural integrity under thermal stress (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 75-80, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 80-87).

Perhaps the most striking contribution to thermostability comes from the disulfide bond formed between Cys275 and Cys292. Multiple biophysical analyses, including thermal denaturation and GdnHCl-induced unfolding experiments, have shown that this disulfide linkage greatly stabilizes the protein by tethering the C-terminus to the core region. Mutating both Cys275 and Cys292 to alanine (C275/292A mutant) lowers the melting temperature by approximately 15°C and decreases the Gibbs free energy of unfolding by about 10.6 kJ/mol relative to the wild-type enzyme. This substantial drop in stability clearly demonstrates that the disulfide bond is a key structural element in preserving the thermal robustness of LCC (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 7-9, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 9-10, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 91-96, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 96-100).

In summary, the thermostability of Cutinase LCC is governed by:
• Phe125 and Phe243, whose alteration modulates hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the folding state, as evidenced by DSC studies (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 12-12).
• A conserved aromatic tryptophan near the active site, contributing to active site integrity through hydrophobic contacts (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4).
• Tyr95, where modification can either enhance or reduce thermal stability based on the nature of the substitution (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 75-80, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 80-87).
• The disulfide bond between Cys275 and Cys292, which is a critical stabilizing element that significantly increases both melting temperature and unfolding free energy (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 7-9, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 9-10, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 91-96, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 96-100).

Cutinase LCC,4EB0,A,S130,Catalytic residue initiating ester bond hydrolysis.,"magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"Cutinase LCC (PDB 4EB0, chain A) displays several key residues whose structural positions and mutagenesis data underscore their essential roles in catalysis, substrate binding, and stability. The catalytic core is formed by a triad of residues—Ser165, Asp210, and His242—that drive ester bond hydrolysis. These residues form a typical α/β-hydrolase active site, where the nucleophilic serine (Ser165) is embedded within a conserved GxSxG motif (GHSMG in LCC) and is situated in a nucleophilic elbow between β5 and α5. The serine initiates catalysis by attacking the substrate ester bond, while Asp210 and His242 complete the charge relay system necessary for efficient catalysis (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

Stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis is accomplished by an oxyanion hole formed primarily by Tyr95 and Met166. The main-chain NH groups of these residues help to stabilize the negative charge that develops on the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate during the reaction. This preformed oxyanion hole is critical to lowering the energy barrier for the acylation step, ensuring rapid turnover (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10).

Beyond the core catalytic residues, a hydrophobic substrate-binding groove facilitates the accommodation of long-chain substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This groove comprises a patch of residues including Tyr95, Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Tyr127, Met166, Trp190, Thr211, Val212, and Phe243. Among these, Phe243 has been highlighted in several studies: saturation mutagenesis experiments (F243I and F243W variants) have shown that altering this phenylalanine not only modulates binding interactions with PET but can also boost catalytic performance by optimizing the balance between substrate binding and product release (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4). In contrast, while Phe125 is part of the binding groove, mutagenesis indicates it does not directly interact with PET-derived intermediates, suggesting a more modulatory rather than an absolutely essential role (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5).

Protein engineering efforts have further underscored the importance of residues that lie outside the immediate catalytic triad. The ICCG-LCC variant, engineered with mutations at Y127 (changed to glycine), D238 (converted to cysteine) and S283 (converted to cysteine) along with the F243I mutation, exhibits a significantly enhanced melting temperature (increased by 9–9.8°C) and improved thermostability. The introduction of a new disulfide bond between Cys238 and Cys283 (or in the wild-type context, between Cys275 and Cys292) anchors the C-terminus, thus providing stability at elevated temperatures—which is essential for PET degradation near its glass-transition temperature (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

Additionally, mutation data indicate that Tyr127 plays an important role in substrate binding within the active site cleft; its modification in engineered variants contributes to both enzyme activity and stability. While not directly catalytic, altering Y127 affects the overall architecture of the binding pocket to enhance substrate interaction dynamics (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

In summary, the essential residues in Cutinase LCC include the three catalytic triad residues (Ser165, Asp210, His242) that underpin the hydrolytic reaction, the oxyanion hole residues (Tyr95 and Met166) that stabilize reaction intermediates, and key binding site residues (F243 and Y127) that modulate substrate interactions. Additional residues forming the hydrophobic groove (Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Trp190, Thr211, and Val212) further support biochemical function, while disulfide-bond-forming cysteines (Cys275 and Cys292) are crucial for maintaining thermal stability. These conclusions are drawn from structural analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and thermostability assessments documented in multiple studies (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4)."

These residues form a typical α/β-hydrolase active site, where the nucleophilic serine (Ser165) is embedded within a conserved GxSxG motif (GHSMG in LCC) and is situated in a nucleophilic elbow between β5 and α5. The serine initiates catalysis by attacking the substrate ester bond, while Asp210 and His242 complete the charge relay system necessary for efficient catalysis (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

Stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis is accomplished by an oxyanion hole formed primarily by Tyr95 and Met166. The main-chain NH groups of these residues help to stabilize the negative charge that develops on the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate during the reaction. This preformed oxyanion hole is critical to lowering the energy barrier for the acylation step, ensuring rapid turnover (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10).

Beyond the core catalytic residues, a hydrophobic substrate-binding groove facilitates the accommodation of long-chain substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This groove comprises a patch of residues including Tyr95, Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Tyr127, Met166, Trp190, Thr211, Val212, and Phe243. Among these, Phe243 has been highlighted in several studies: saturation mutagenesis experiments (F243I and F243W variants) have shown that altering this phenylalanine not only modulates binding interactions with PET but can also boost catalytic performance by optimizing the balance between substrate binding and product release (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4). In contrast, while Phe125 is part of the binding groove, mutagenesis indicates it does not directly interact with PET-derived intermediates, suggesting a more modulatory rather than an absolutely essential role (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5).

Protein engineering efforts have further underscored the importance of residues that lie outside the immediate catalytic triad. The ICCG-LCC variant, engineered with mutations at Y127 (changed to glycine), D238 (converted to cysteine) and S283 (converted to cysteine) along with the F243I mutation, exhibits a significantly enhanced melting temperature (increased by 9–9.8°C) and improved thermostability. The introduction of a new disulfide bond between Cys238 and Cys283 (or in the wild-type context, between Cys275 and Cys292) anchors the C-terminus, thus providing stability at elevated temperatures—which is essential for PET degradation near its glass-transition temperature (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

Additionally, mutation data indicate that Tyr127 plays an important role in substrate binding within the active site cleft; its modification in engineered variants contributes to both enzyme activity and stability. While not directly catalytic, altering Y127 affects the overall architecture of the binding pocket to enhance substrate interaction dynamics (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

In summary, the essential residues in Cutinase LCC include the three catalytic triad residues (Ser165, Asp210, His242) that underpin the hydrolytic reaction, the oxyanion hole residues (Tyr95 and Met166) that stabilize reaction intermediates, and key binding site residues (F243 and Y127) that modulate substrate interactions. Additional residues forming the hydrophobic groove (Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Trp190, Thr211, and Val212) further support biochemical function, while disulfide-bond-forming cysteines (Cys275 and Cys292) are crucial for maintaining thermal stability. These conclusions are drawn from structural analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and thermostability assessments documented in multiple studies (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4)."

The introduction of a new disulfide bond between Cys238 and Cys283 (or in the wild-type context, between Cys275 and Cys292) anchors the C-terminus, thus providing stability at elevated temperatures—which is essential for PET degradation near its glass-transition temperature (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

Additionally, mutation data indicate that Tyr127 plays an important role in substrate binding within the active site cleft; its modification in engineered variants contributes to both enzyme activity and stability. While not directly catalytic, altering Y127 affects the overall architecture of the binding pocket to enhance substrate interaction dynamics (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2).

In summary, the essential residues in Cutinase LCC include the three catalytic triad residues (Ser165, Asp210, His242) that underpin the hydrolytic reaction, the oxyanion hole residues (Tyr95 and Met166) that stabilize reaction intermediates, and key binding site residues (F243 and Y127) that modulate substrate interactions. Additional residues forming the hydrophobic groove (Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Trp190, Thr211, and Val212) further support biochemical function, while disulfide-bond-forming cysteines (Cys275 and Cys292) are crucial for maintaining thermal stability. These conclusions are drawn from structural analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and thermostability assessments documented in multiple studies (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4)."

The catalytic core is formed by a triad of residues—Ser165, Asp210, and His242—that drive ester bond hydrolysis. These residues form a typical α/β-hydrolase active site, where the nucleophilic serine (Ser165) is embedded within a conserved GxSxG motif (GHSMG in LCC) and is situated in a nucleophilic elbow between β5 and α5. The serine initiates catalysis by attacking the substrate ester bond, while Asp210 and His242 complete the charge relay system necessary for efficient catalysis (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

Stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis is accomplished by an oxyanion hole formed primarily by Tyr95 and Met166. The main-chain NH groups of these residues help to stabilize the negative charge that develops on the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate during the reaction. This preformed oxyanion hole is critical to lowering the energy barrier for the acylation step, ensuring rapid turnover (magalhaes2021perspectivesonthe pages 22-23, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 7-10).

Beyond the core catalytic residues, a hydrophobic substrate-binding groove facilitates the accommodation of long-chain substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This groove comprises a patch of residues including Tyr95, Thr96, Ala97, Phe125, Tyr127, Met166, Trp190, Thr211, Val212, and Phe243. Among these, Phe243 has been highlighted in several studies: saturation mutagenesis experiments (F243I and F243W variants) have shown that altering this phenylalanine not only modulates binding interactions with PET but can also boost catalytic performance by optimizing the balance between substrate binding and product release (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4). In contrast, while Phe125 is part of the binding groove, mutagenesis indicates it does not directly interact with PET-derived intermediates, suggesting a more modulatory rather than an absolutely essential role (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5).

In particular, the data support roles for Tyr95, Ile179, Ser185, Ser209, and Cys210.

Tyr95 is the most extensively studied residue in this system. Positioned in the center of a hydrophobic patch at the substrate‐binding pocket, Tyr95 contributes to forming the preformed oxyanion hole together with Met166. Site‐directed mutagenesis of this residue has demonstrated that when it is replaced by alanine (Y95A), the enzyme displays a significant loss in PET- and PCL-degrading activity and reduced thermal stability. In contrast, substitution with phenylalanine (Y95F) largely conserves activity and even shifts the enzyme’s optimum temperature upward, likely by eliminating the hydroxyl group that otherwise introduces steric hindrance within the hydrophobic environment. Although the study does not directly label Tyr95 as “allosteric,” the mutation outcomes imply that ligand binding to the hydrophobic pocket (which includes Tyr95) helps stabilize a catalytically competent conformation under heat stress—a phenomenon characteristic of local allosteric regulation or conformational switching (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 75-80, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 80-87).

In addition to Tyr95, mutation studies have identified residues in adjacent regions that modulate substrate binding and activity through conformational influences. Ile179 is one such residue. Mutational substitutions at position 179 (e.g., I179Q, I179V, I179F, I179T) have been reported to improve substrate binding by reducing steric hindrance, thereby suggesting that conformational adjustments around this site can propagate to regulate catalysis (bala2023explorationofreconstructed pages 133-134).

Similarly, Ser185 has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism. Variants such as S185H affect activity in a manner consistent with perturbing local conformational dynamics, indicating that this residue may function within a regulatory network governing active site geometry (bala2023explorationofreconstructed pages 133-134).

Furthermore, Ser209 plays a role in controlling access to the substrate-binding pocket. Experimental data show that certain substitutions, for example S209F or S209V, tend to decrease activity; the S209A mutation, in contrast, allows alternative binding orientations for nearby residues (e.g., W156), thus altering the substrate-binding landscape. Such observations imply that Ser209 is part of a network that affects conformational switching during substrate engagement (bala2023explorationofreconstructed pages 133-134).

Finally, Cys210 is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the active site. The mutation C210A disrupts a key disulfide bond, leading to complete loss of activity. This result highlights that the disulfide link provided by Cys210 is not merely a static structural feature, but rather it is essential for preserving conformations necessary for catalytic function. In this way, the integrity of the region—mediated by Cys210—may participate in conformational switching processes (bala2023explorationofreconstructed pages 133-134).

Overall, while the Sulaiman et al. data primarily focus on Tyr95 and its substrate‐induced stabilization effects, studies reported by Bala et al. provide complementary evidence that additional residues—Ile179, Ser185, Ser209, and Cys210—contribute to modulation of the enzyme’s conformational landscape, thereby indirectly participating in allosteric regulation or conformational switching mechanisms. These findings are supported by multiple mutagenesis and biophysical analyses reported in the literature (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75, bala2023explorationofreconstructed pages 133-134)."

The evidence points to two distinct groups: those that directly participate in catalysis and transition‐state stabilization, and those that form a hydrophobic, aromatic binding pocket that modulates ligand interaction.

First, the central catalytic triad—Ser165, Asp210, and His242—is conserved in LCC cutinase and is essential for ester bond hydrolysis. Ser165, located within the conserved GXSXG motif at the nucleophilic elbow, is the reactive residue that initiates the attack on the substrate’s carbonyl carbon, while Asp210 and His242 operate to stabilize and polarize the serine’s hydroxyl group during catalysis. This catalytic triad is critical not only for chemical turnover but also plays a role in the proper orientation and stabilization of the substrate in the active site (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 115-121).

Closely associated with the catalytic machinery is the preformed oxyanion hole, composed of Tyr95 and Met166. This structural feature provides hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate that forms during catalysis. Tyr95, in particular, has been the focus of multiple mutagenesis studies. Its bulky aromatic side chain contributes to forming a hydrophobic patch along the substrate binding groove. Experiments substituting Tyr95 with alanine resulted in a significant drop in enzyme activity against both PET and polymer analog substrates, directly implicating this residue in substrate recognition and binding specificity. Conversely, replacement with phenylalanine—retaining hydrophobicity but with reduced steric bulk—preserves native-like activity while slightly modifying structure, further supporting the functional necessity of the aromatic character at this site (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 80-87).

In addition to these conserved catalytic residues, several hydrophobic and aromatic residues line the substrate binding pocket and are implicated in fine-tuning binding affinity and specificity. Notably, F243 has been identified as a key player in mediating substrate interactions. Structural and mutational analyses, including experiments where F243 was mutated to isoleucine (F243I) or tryptophan (F243W), demonstrated that modifications at this site can significantly affect PET degradation yield. Although F243 is not in direct contact with the substrate in all modeled conformations, its involvement in π-stacking interactions and its position at one end of the binding groove suggest that it contributes indirectly by modulating the overall binding environment. In contrast, F125, another phenylalanine present in the enzyme, does not engage directly with the ligand; its role may be supportive in maintaining the overall structural integrity of the binding pocket rather than directly mediating ligand contact (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 6-6).

Further evidence from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations highlights a network of residues—including Y127 and W190—that additionally contribute to shaping the binding groove. Y127, identified among residues interacting with PET model substrates, reinforces the hydrophobic environment necessary for binding and might also help in orienting the substrate for catalysis (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7).

The evidence points to two distinct groups: those that directly participate in catalysis and transition‐state stabilization, and those that form a hydrophobic, aromatic binding pocket that modulates ligand interaction.

First, the central catalytic triad—Ser165, Asp210, and His242—is conserved in LCC cutinase and is essential for ester bond hydrolysis. Ser165, located within the conserved GXSXG motif at the nucleophilic elbow, is the reactive residue that initiates the attack on the substrate’s carbonyl carbon, while Asp210 and His242 operate to stabilize and polarize the serine’s hydroxyl group during catalysis. This catalytic triad is critical not only for chemical turnover but also plays a role in the proper orientation and stabilization of the substrate in the active site (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 115-121).

Closely associated with the catalytic machinery is the preformed oxyanion hole, composed of Tyr95 and Met166. This structural feature provides hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate that forms during catalysis. Tyr95, in particular, has been the focus of multiple mutagenesis studies. Its bulky aromatic side chain contributes to forming a hydrophobic patch along the substrate binding groove. Experiments substituting Tyr95 with alanine resulted in a significant drop in enzyme activity against both PET and polymer analog substrates, directly implicating this residue in substrate recognition and binding specificity. Conversely, replacement with phenylalanine—retaining hydrophobicity but with reduced steric bulk—preserves native-like activity while slightly modifying structure, further supporting the functional necessity of the aromatic character at this site (sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 80-87).

In addition to these conserved catalytic residues, several hydrophobic and aromatic residues line the substrate binding pocket and are implicated in fine-tuning binding affinity and specificity. Notably, F243 has been identified as a key player in mediating substrate interactions. Structural and mutational analyses, including experiments where F243 was mutated to isoleucine (F243I) or tryptophan (F243W), demonstrated that modifications at this site can significantly affect PET degradation yield. Although F243 is not in direct contact with the substrate in all modeled conformations, its involvement in π-stacking interactions and its position at one end of the binding groove suggest that it contributes indirectly by modulating the overall binding environment. In contrast, F125, another phenylalanine present in the enzyme, does not engage directly with the ligand; its role may be supportive in maintaining the overall structural integrity of the binding pocket rather than directly mediating ligand contact (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-5, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 6-6).

Ser165 is located in the nucleophilic elbow within the conserved pentapeptide GxSxG motif (in LCC, specifically GHSMG) and is directly responsible for attacking the ester bond in substrates. Asp210 and His242 complete this triad, with their roles in positioning and proton shuttling proven to be essential for catalysis. Multiple structural and mutagenesis studies have confirmed that these residues are fully conserved and indispensable in homologous enzymes for their hydrolytic activities (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2).

2. Oxyanion hole residues – Tyr95 and Met166  
The oxyanion hole is critical for stabilizing the negatively charged transition state during catalysis. In LCC, Tyr95 and Met166 form this stabilizing pocket. Tyr95, in particular, has been the subject of extensive mutagenesis experiments; substitutions at this position (such as Y95A and Y95F) have shown marked effects on both enzymatic activity and thermal stability. Its conservation underscores a dual role in substrate binding and in maintaining the integrity of the active site conformation (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75).

3. Disulfide bond-forming residues – Cys275 and Cys292  
Cys275 and Cys292 are conserved in LCC and homologues, forming a disulfide bond that anchors the C-terminal region to a nearby loop. This bond is crucial for the overall structural integrity and thermostability of the enzyme. Experimental evidence, including comparisons to mutants lacking this bond (which exhibit decreased thermodynamic and kinetic stability), demonstrates that this disulfide linkage is a common strategy among cutinases to withstand high temperatures and maintain an active conformation (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65).

LC-cutinase shares with other homologues several calcium-binding motifs that contribute to its stability. The high-affinity calcium-binding site (site 2) is comprised of D238, S283, and E208, which when occupied by Ca2+ help reinforce the enzyme’s conformation, thereby enhancing both stability and function. A second, lower-affinity site involves D193 and T195. The conservation of these residues among related enzymes underscores their importance in modulating enzyme stability under various conditions (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7).

Mutation studies (e.g., F243I) have shown enhanced activity in some LCC variants, suggesting that F243 is involved in initial substrate binding, possibly through hydrophobic interactions. Though its conservation is highlighted in comparative studies, its role seems to be more about fine-tuning the binding and catalytic efficiency rather than a principal structural function (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4).

1. Catalytic triad – Ser165, Asp210, and His242  
These three residues form the catalytic core that drives hydrolysis in LCC and other cutinases. Ser165 is located in the nucleophilic elbow within the conserved pentapeptide GxSxG motif (in LCC, specifically GHSMG) and is directly responsible for attacking the ester bond in substrates. Asp210 and His242 complete this triad, with their roles in positioning and proton shuttling proven to be essential for catalysis. Multiple structural and mutagenesis studies have confirmed that these residues are fully conserved and indispensable in homologous enzymes for their hydrolytic activities (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2).

2. Oxyanion hole residues – Tyr95 and Met166  
The oxyanion hole is critical for stabilizing the negatively charged transition state during catalysis. In LCC, Tyr95 and Met166 form this stabilizing pocket. Tyr95, in particular, has been the subject of extensive mutagenesis experiments; substitutions at this position (such as Y95A and Y95F) have shown marked effects on both enzymatic activity and thermal stability. Its conservation underscores a dual role in substrate binding and in maintaining the integrity of the active site conformation (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75).

3. Disulfide bond-forming residues – Cys275 and Cys292  
Cys275 and Cys292 are conserved in LCC and homologues, forming a disulfide bond that anchors the C-terminal region to a nearby loop. This bond is crucial for the overall structural integrity and thermostability of the enzyme. Experimental evidence, including comparisons to mutants lacking this bond (which exhibit decreased thermodynamic and kinetic stability), demonstrates that this disulfide linkage is a common strategy among cutinases to withstand high temperatures and maintain an active conformation (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65).

4. Calcium-binding residues – D238, S283, and E208 (as well as D193 and T195 in a secondary site)  
LC-cutinase shares with other homologues several calcium-binding motifs that contribute to its stability. The high-affinity calcium-binding site (site 2) is comprised of D238, S283, and E208, which when occupied by Ca2+ help reinforce the enzyme’s conformation, thereby enhancing both stability and function. A second, lower-affinity site involves D193 and T195. The conservation of these residues among related enzymes underscores their importance in modulating enzyme stability under various conditions (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7).

5. Additional conserved aromatic residue – F243  
While not part of the classical catalytic or stability motifs, F243 has emerged as a conserved aromatic residue within the active site region that appears influential in substrate interaction. Mutation studies (e.g., F243I) have shown enhanced activity in some LCC variants, suggesting that F243 is involved in initial substrate binding, possibly through hydrophobic interactions. Though its conservation is highlighted in comparative studies, its role seems to be more about fine-tuning the binding and catalytic efficiency rather than a principal structural function (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4).

In summary, the catalytic triad (Ser165, Asp210, His242) is universally conserved and essential for hydrolysis, while Tyr95 and Met166 stabilize the transition state through the oxyanion hole.

The disulfide bond formed by Cys275 and Cys292, along with the calcium-coordinating residues (D238, S283, E208, D193, and T195), provides the structural framework that supports the enzyme’s high thermostability. Additionally, residues like F243, by contributing to substrate recognition and binding, further refine the enzyme’s functional profile (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2)."
Cutinase LCC,4EB0,A,D158,"Part of the secondary calcium-binding site, modulating stability.",sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7,literature,,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,"The most critical highly conserved residues in LCC (PDB 4EB0, chain A) fall into distinct groups that support catalytic function and structural stability:

1. Catalytic triad – Ser165, Asp210, and His242  
These three residues form the catalytic core that drives hydrolysis in LCC and other cutinases. Ser165 is located in the nucleophilic elbow within the conserved pentapeptide GxSxG motif (in LCC, specifically GHSMG) and is directly responsible for attacking the ester bond in substrates. Asp210 and His242 complete this triad, with their roles in positioning and proton shuttling proven to be essential for catalysis. Multiple structural and mutagenesis studies have confirmed that these residues are fully conserved and indispensable in homologous enzymes for their hydrolytic activities (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2).

2. Oxyanion hole residues – Tyr95 and Met166  
The oxyanion hole is critical for stabilizing the negatively charged transition state during catalysis. In LCC, Tyr95 and Met166 form this stabilizing pocket. Tyr95, in particular, has been the subject of extensive mutagenesis experiments; substitutions at this position (such as Y95A and Y95F) have shown marked effects on both enzymatic activity and thermal stability. Its conservation underscores a dual role in substrate binding and in maintaining the integrity of the active site conformation (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 70-75).

3. Disulfide bond-forming residues – Cys275 and Cys292  
Cys275 and Cys292 are conserved in LCC and homologues, forming a disulfide bond that anchors the C-terminal region to a nearby loop. This bond is crucial for the overall structural integrity and thermostability of the enzyme. Experimental evidence, including comparisons to mutants lacking this bond (which exhibit decreased thermodynamic and kinetic stability), demonstrates that this disulfide linkage is a common strategy among cutinases to withstand high temperatures and maintain an active conformation (sulaiman2014crystalstructureand pages 1-2, sulaiman2014structurestabilityand pages 59-65).

4. Calcium-binding residues – D238, S283, and E208 (as well as D193 and T195 in a secondary site)  
LC-cutinase shares with other homologues several calcium-binding motifs that contribute to its stability. The high-affinity calcium-binding site (site 2) is comprised of D238, S283, and E208, which when occupied by Ca2+ help reinforce the enzyme’s conformation, thereby enhancing both stability and function. A second, lower-affinity site involves D193 and T195. The conservation of these residues among related enzymes underscores their importance in modulating enzyme stability under various conditions (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 4-7).

5. Additional conserved aromatic residue – F243  
While not part of the classical catalytic or stability motifs, F243 has emerged as a conserved aromatic residue within the active site region that appears influential in substrate interaction. Mutation studies (e.g., F243I) have shown enhanced activity in some LCC variants, suggesting that F243 is involved in initial substrate binding, possibly through hydrophobic interactions. Though its conservation is highlighted in comparative studies, its role seems to be more about fine-tuning the binding and catalytic efficiency rather than a principal structural function (mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 2-2, mrigwani2023counter‐intuitiveenhancementof pages 4-4).
