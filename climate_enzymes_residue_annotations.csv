Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,F209,Mutation affects binding site flexibility and stability.,sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13,literature,F248R,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The evidence clearly indicates that several specific residues in Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) are key determinants of its thermostability by altering the melting temperature (Tm) and unfolding free energy (ΔG°). Below is a detailed discussion of each residue, along with the rationale and supporting literature citations:

1. D204 and E253  
These two residues are perhaps the most intensively studied in relation to thermostability. By engineering mutations that replace D204 and E253 with cysteine (D204C/E253C), a disulfide bond is introduced in the calcium‐binding region. This covalent link significantly rigidifies the local structure and raises the melting temperature—from around 69.8°C to as high as 94.7°C in certain variants. Alternative substitutions, such as D204R/E253R, can also increase Tm by over 14°C; however, they may slightly impair PET-degrading activity. This clearly demonstrates that D204 and E253 are central to achieving higher thermostability through both disulfide bridge formation and salt‐bridge networking in the active enzyme (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 49-52).

2. S121 and D174  
These residues have been effectively targeted in a triple mutant variant (S121P/D174S/D204P). Introduction of a proline at S121 and a serine at D174 (in combination with a proline at D204) leads to an increase in the melting temperature by approximately 9.3°C. Moreover, this engineered variant displayed a remarkable 46-fold enhancement in PET degradation at 70°C. The improvement reflects both enhanced rigidity and reduced local flexibility at the active site surroundings, key factors in thermal stability and catalytic efficiency (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 54-56).

3. G62  
Mutational studies indicate that substitution of glycine at position 62 by alanine (G62A) helps the enzyme maintain its integrity during prolonged thermal treatment—in this case, stability was preserved after 24 hours at 65°C. This suggests that G62, likely positioned near regions important for substrate binding, plays a role in modulating local flexibility which in turn contributes to overall thermostability (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 11-13).

4. I213 (and equivalently N213)  
Two mutations at position 213 have drawn attention. On one hand, the I213S variant is reported to exhibit the highest thermostability amongst several mutants, indicating that even subtle adjustments at this site can enhance the rigidity and folding energy of the protein. On the other hand, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a proline substitution (N213P) at this equivalent position further increases structural rigidity. The conclusion is that residue 213 is a hotspot where even small changes can tune the ΔG° of unfolding by stiffening the local structure (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

5. L90, F209, and F249  
The residue L90 plays a dual role; its mutation is highly sensitive to the nature of the substitution. L90F specifically increased degradation activity (by about 1.5-fold) and is thought to favorably influence the enzyme conformation for stability, while the L90A mutation dramatically reduced degradation activity (by nearly 11.2-fold), suggesting that this position must maintain a delicate equilibrium between catalytic function and structural stability. Similarly, F209 and F249 are part of the hydrophobic patch near the substrate binding cavity. While F209I severely decreases enzymatic activity, F249R impacts binding site flexibility—thus, these residues indirectly affect thermostability by modulating the conformational dynamics of the active site (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, 11-13).

In summary, thermally stabilizing mutations in Thermobifida fusca cutinase predominantly target residues that influence either covalent stabilization (D204 and E253), active-site rigidity (S121, D174, and I213/N213), or the delicate balance between catalytic efficiency and stability (L90, F209, F249). These findings, derived largely from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and computational analyses, provide robust evidence that altering these specific residues can significantly increase the enzyme’s melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding, making it more suitable for industrial applications at elevated temperatures (sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11, 11-13, tournier2023enzymes’powerfor pages 49-52, 52-54, 54-56)."
Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,S130,Part of the catalytic triad; acts as the nucleophile in ester bond hydrolysis.,"chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9",literature,S169A,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The enzyme in PDB 5ZOA chain A, a Thermobifida fusca cutinase, has been characterized as having a canonical catalytic triad and additional structural features critical for its biochemical function.

The catalytic triad is composed of three residues that work together to perform ester bond hydrolysis. The serine residue—in this case, Ser170—is positioned within a “nucleophile elbow,” a conserved structural motif of the α/β-hydrolase fold. This serine acts as the nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate’s ester bond. Its essential role is supported by active‐site inhibition studies using PMSF, which irreversibly modifies the serine, and by mutagenesis experiments that show substitution of Ser170 with alanine completely abolishes enzymatic activity (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

His248 constitutes the second member of the triad and functions as a general base. During catalysis, His248 is responsible for abstracting a proton from the nucleophilic serine, thereby facilitating its attack on the substrate. Structural homology modeling and biochemical assays have reinforced the critical role of His248 in this proton transfer process (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

The third residue in the triad is an aspartate, which in this enzyme is Asp216. This residue positions and stabilizes His248, ensuring its proper orientation and charge-relay function during the catalytic cycle. The importance of Asp216 is validated by its conservation in related α/β-hydrolases and further supported by both mutagenesis and inhibitor studies (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 8-9).

Beyond the catalytic triad, the structure features an oxyanion hole that stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate formed during hydrolysis. The oxyanion hole in this enzyme is predicted to be formed by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100. These residues provide critical hydrogen bonds that stabilize the negative charge during the formation of the reaction intermediate, a feature typical of serine hydrolases (chen2008identificationandcharacterization pages 7-8).

In addition to these core catalytic residues, a key disulfide bond has been identified between Cys241 and Cys259. While not directly involved in the chemical steps of catalysis, this disulfide linkage is essential for maintaining the proper folding and thermostability of the enzyme. Stability assays and kinetic studies have demonstrated that disruption of this disulfide bond leads to reduced catalytic efficiency, underscoring its indirect but vital role in biochemical function (chen2019contributionofdisulfide pages 17-23).

There is also evidence from structure-guided engineering studies that residues surrounding the active site can modulate substrate binding and turnover. For example, surface residues such as Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213 have been implicated in substrate positioning and binding. Mutagenesis of Leu90 and Ile213 has been shown to influence the catalytic rate—altering these residues can either enhance or impair activity, particularly on larger polymeric substrates like PET. These findings suggest that while Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213 are not directly involved in the chemical catalysis, they are essential for optimal substrate interaction and overall catalytic performance (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In summary, the essential residues in T. fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) for catalytic and biochemical function include the catalytic triad—Ser170, His248, and Asp216—supported by the oxyanion hole residues Met171 and Tyr100, and the structural disulfide bond formed by Cys241 and Cys259. Additionally, substrate binding is fine-tuned by residues such as Tyr60, Leu90, and Ile213.

Cutinase ( Thermobifida fusca ),5ZOA,A,S130,"Primary nucleophile in the catalytic triad, essential for ester bond cleavage.",cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"The Thermobifida fusca cutinase in PDB 5ZOA chain A has been shown to mediate substrate binding and specificity through a combination of catalytic, stabilizing, and structural residues. The data indicate that three main sets of residues collectively fulfill these roles.

First, the catalytic triad is central to enzyme activity. In this enzyme, Ser170 is situated in a conserved nucleophilic “G‑H‑S‑M‑G” motif that forms the nucleophilic elbow essential for ester bond cleavage. Although His248 and Asp216 complete the triad to orchestrate proton transfers and stabilization during catalysis, Ser170 is the primary actor in nucleophilic attack. This residue is positioned such that it is in close proximity to the scissile bond in substrate docking studies, facilitating catalysis (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50).

Second, substrate binding and transition state stabilization are largely mediated by the oxyanion hole residues. Here, Met171 and Tyr100 have been identified as key contributors. These residues form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate’s ester bond, thereby stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate that forms during nucleophilic attack. The docking data show that the substrate consistently forms hydrogen bonds with these residues, ensuring that the reactive bond is properly oriented relative to Ser170. This precise interaction underlies both effective ligand binding and substrate specificity (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

Third, structural determinants modulate accessibility and the accommodation of substrates within the active site. Protein engineering studies have revealed that residues such as Leu90 and Ile213, which are located near the substrate binding pocket, influence the conformation and hydrophobic character of the binding groove. Specifically, replacing these bulky residues with smaller ones (e.g., Leu90Ala and Ile213Ala) has been shown to increase enzyme activity by reducing steric hindrance and enhancing substrate access. This effect not only confirms their role in shaping the binding site but also underscores the importance of the steric and hydrophobic environment for substrate specificity and turnover (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In docking simulations, the oligo-polyester mimic substrates were shown to partially insert into an exposed hydrophobic groove of the enzyme. While one part of the ligand interacts directly with the active site (through hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion hole residues), the remaining portion is solvent-exposed. This architecture ensures that substrates with bulky aliphatic or aromatic regions are properly accommodated without disrupting the catalytic arrangement. Thus, the combined action of the catalytic triad (particularly Ser170), the oxyanion hole (Met171 and Tyr100), and the additional structural residues (Leu90 and Ile213) provides a finely tuned balance that confers both binding affinity and specificity to the enzyme (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

In summary, Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) uses Ser170 for nucleophilic catalysis, while Met171 and Tyr100 stabilize the reaction intermediate via the oxyanion hole. Residues such as Leu90 and Ile213 contribute to the architecture of the binding groove by modulating its steric and hydrophobic properties, thereby influencing substrate accessibility and overall catalytic efficiency. These conclusions are supported by structural, mutagenesis, and docking studies reported in the literature (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11)."

Third, structural determinants modulate accessibility and the accommodation of substrates within the active site. Protein engineering studies have revealed that residues such as Leu90 and Ile213, which are located near the substrate binding pocket, influence the conformation and hydrophobic character of the binding groove. Specifically, replacing these bulky residues with smaller ones (e.g., Leu90Ala and Ile213Ala) has been shown to increase enzyme activity by reducing steric hindrance and enhancing substrate access. This effect not only confirms their role in shaping the binding site but also underscores the importance of the steric and hydrophobic environment for substrate specificity and turnover (dong2020structureguidedengineeringof pages 1-2, sui2023recentadvancesin pages 10-11).

In docking simulations, the oligo-polyester mimic substrates were shown to partially insert into an exposed hydrophobic groove of the enzyme. While one part of the ligand interacts directly with the active site (through hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion hole residues), the remaining portion is solvent-exposed. This architecture ensures that substrates with bulky aliphatic or aromatic regions are properly accommodated without disrupting the catalytic arrangement. Thus, the combined action of the catalytic triad (particularly Ser170), the oxyanion hole (Met171 and Tyr100), and the additional structural residues (Leu90 and Ile213) provides a finely tuned balance that confers both binding affinity and specificity to the enzyme (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, oliveira2025evaluatingcutinasefrom pages 10-12).

In summary, Thermobifida fusca cutinase (PDB 5ZOA chain A) uses Ser170 for nucleophilic catalysis, while Met171 and Tyr100 stabilize the reaction intermediate via the oxyanion hole.

Equally important to catalysis is the formation of the oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the tetrahedral transition state intermediate during substrate hydrolysis. In this enzyme, the oxyanion hole is constituted by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100.

In addition to the active site residues, structural stability is enhanced by a putative disulfide bond formed by Cys281 and Cys299.

Although some studies report a slight variation in the numbering (e.g., Asp218 in other homologues), the residue occupying this position is conserved and critical for function (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 12-14).

Equally important to catalysis is the formation of the oxyanion hole, which stabilizes the tetrahedral transition state intermediate during substrate hydrolysis. In this enzyme, the oxyanion hole is constituted by the backbone amides of Met171 and Tyr100. Met171 contributes to shaping the oxyanion hole through its positioning immediately after the nucleophilic serine, while Tyr100 is implicated in hydrogen-bonding to stabilize the negatively charged oxygen in the transition state. These residues are not only conserved but have been validated by both structural and mutagenesis studies as essential for lowering the activation energy of the reaction (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 12-14).

In addition to the active site residues, structural stability is enhanced by a putative disulfide bond formed by Cys281 and Cys299. Disulfide bonds are well known for their role in stabilizing protein folds, particularly in enzymes that need to maintain activity under thermal stress. The conservation of these cysteine residues across homologues suggests that this disulfide linkage is an evolutionarily maintained feature, likely contributing to the thermostability observed in Thermobifida fusca cutinases (cunha2021computationaldevelopmentof pages 47-50, hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 3-7).

While the catalytic triad, oxyanion hole, and disulfide-bond forming residues are directly highlighted, it is worth noting that additional residues, such as certain tryptophans described in related studies (e.g., Trp105, Trp195, Trp201, and Trp265 in homologues), have roles in maintaining tertiary packing and structural integrity. These tryptophan residues, predominantly buried in hydrophobic pockets, contribute to intrinsic fluorescence properties and overall enzyme stability; however, for PDB 5ZOA chain A the primary functional and stability conservation centers on the aforementioned catalytic and disulfide-bond residues (hegde2014structuralstabilityand pages 3-7).

Two different sets of residues emerge as key determinants of thermostability: those involved in salt‐bridge formation near the N‐terminal region and those that contribute to the hydrophobic core packing and dimer stabilization.

One experimental series focused on the N‐terminal segment of EST2. In studies by Foglia and colleagues, deletion of the first 35 N‐terminal residues (which include Ser35 and Tyr22) produced a variant (EST2-36del) with decreased conformational stability and a lower melting temperature compared to the full‐length protein. The disruption of this segment likely perturbs the overall domain coupling that is essential for resisting thermal denaturation (foglia2007roleofthe pages 1-6). Equally significant is Lys102, a residue that forms a strong interdomain salt bridge with Glu43 in a loop linking helix α2 to strand β1. The K102Q mutation, which abolishes this salt bridge, results in lower thermostability as evidenced by shifts in melting temperature and altered unfolding enthalpy. These experiments indicate that the salt bridge between Lys102 and Glu43 plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the core structure; replacing Lys102 disrupts this electrostatic interaction and undermines the energy barrier (ΔG° of unfolding) necessary for thermal resilience (foglia2007roleofthe pages 24-36).

In addition to these salt-bridge interactions, key hydrophobic residues that stabilize the protein’s quaternary structure have been identified from mutational studies in hyperthermophilic homologs such as EstE1. Byun and colleagues demonstrated that in EstE1—structurally similar to EST2—residues Val274 and Phe276 located at the dimer interface are crucial for dimerization and for maintaining a high apparent melting temperature. Although these studies were performed on EstE1, the strong structural similarities with EST2 suggest that analogous hydrophobic contacts are important for EST2 as well (byun2007crystalstructureof pages 6-7, byun2007crystalstructureof pages 7-8). Moreover, work by Rhee et al. on EstE1 highlighted that mutations of residues involved in tight hydrophobic packing (e.g., Ala75 in EstE1, which is likely analogous to a similarly positioned residue in EST2) led to the most dramatic decreases in melting temperature—by decreasing the filling of a critical hydrophobic cavity, they compromise the free energy of unfolding (rhee2006analysisofthe pages 3-4). Similarly, residues that contribute to ion pair networks such as Arg97 and Arg147, when mutated in EstE1, produced lower thermostability.

In summary, the key thermostability determinants identified in Carboxyl-esterase EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) are:

Carboxyl-esterase EST2,1EVQ,A,M209,Part of a region controlling substrate selectivity; M211S mutation alters substrate usage.,soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122,literature,M210S,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,"The structural studies on EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) show that its ligand binding and substrate specificity are dictated by both the canonical catalytic machinery and additional residues lining the substrate‐binding pocket. The catalytic triad—which is critical for all esterase activity—is composed of Ser130, Glu245, and His274. In EST2, Ser130 serves as the nucleophile that initiates the attack on the ester bond and is positioned on the “nucleophilic elbow” within the conserved V-GDS(A/V)GGN motif, while His274 functions as a general base to activate Ser130 for nucleophilic attack; Glu245, although unusual compared to the more common aspartate, completes the triad and participates in proton transfer during catalysis (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

In addition to the triad, the oxyanion hole—typically characterized by a conserved HGGG motif—plays an essential role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state, thereby facilitating catalysis though no individual residue number is explicitly provided for EST2 in the excerpt (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117). The presence of this motif is a hallmark of the α/β hydrolase fold and is conserved among hormone-sensitive lipases, including EST2.

Residues lining the substrate-binding channel further fine-tune ligand specificity. Evidence from site-directed mutagenesis in homologous enzymes indicates that W87, although not directly located in the binding pocket, influences substrate affinity since mutation from tryptophan to phenylalanine (W87F) reduces affinity while leaving substrate range largely unaltered. This suggests that the bulk or electronic properties of W87 have an indirect role in optimal substrate orientation (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Similarly, residue V158 has been shown to be critical in determining the space within the binding site. Mutation of Val158 to alanine (V158A) increases the substrate spectrum and affinity by enlarging the substrate pocket near the catalytic serine and the adjacent oxyanion hole, thereby permitting the accommodation of bulkier acyl chains (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Another set of residues that appears important in controlling substrate selectivity lies near positions 211–215. Double mutations at M211 and R215 (M211S and R215L) have been found to alter substrate usage in EST2 toward longer acyl chains; in homologous enzymes such as Streptomyces EstA, the residue corresponding to W213 is similarly implicated, with mutations (e.g., W213R) leading to changes in substrate spectrum. This region thus seems to form part of the structural framework that directs substrate orientation and chain-length specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Furthermore, conserved proline residues within recognized sequence motifs also contribute structurally. In EST2, the proline within the Q-L-YP motif (P184) is located inside the enzyme pocket where its inherent rigidity likely maintains the geometry of the binding site and assists in substrate positioning, in contrast to the proline in the YRLAPE motif that lies away from the pocket (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117).

Lastly, the overall architecture of EST2 includes an N-terminal α-helical extension that partially covers the active site, imposing a steric constraint that limits substrate chain length and thereby determines specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 110-113, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

Together, these residues – the catalytic triad (Ser130, Glu245, His274), the oxyanion hole’s HGGG motif, W87, V158, M211, R215 (and its associated region including W213), and the structurally important P184 – form an integrated network that mediate ligand binding and specificity in EST2 (PDB 1EVQ chain A) (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117, soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5)."

The catalytic triad—which is critical for all esterase activity—is composed of Ser130, Glu245, and His274. In EST2, Ser130 serves as the nucleophile that initiates the attack on the ester bond and is positioned on the “nucleophilic elbow” within the conserved V-GDS(A/V)GGN motif, while His274 functions as a general base to activate Ser130 for nucleophilic attack; Glu245, although unusual compared to the more common aspartate, completes the triad and participates in proton transfer during catalysis (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122, rozeboom2014crystalstructuresof pages 4-5).

In addition to the triad, the oxyanion hole—typically characterized by a conserved HGGG motif—plays an essential role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state, thereby facilitating catalysis though no individual residue number is explicitly provided for EST2 in the excerpt (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 113-117). The presence of this motif is a hallmark of the α/β hydrolase fold and is conserved among hormone-sensitive lipases, including EST2.

Residues lining the substrate-binding channel further fine-tune ligand specificity. Evidence from site-directed mutagenesis in homologous enzymes indicates that W87, although not directly located in the binding pocket, influences substrate affinity since mutation from tryptophan to phenylalanine (W87F) reduces affinity while leaving substrate range largely unaltered. This suggests that the bulk or electronic properties of W87 have an indirect role in optimal substrate orientation (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Similarly, residue V158 has been shown to be critical in determining the space within the binding site. Mutation of Val158 to alanine (V158A) increases the substrate spectrum and affinity by enlarging the substrate pocket near the catalytic serine and the adjacent oxyanion hole, thereby permitting the accommodation of bulkier acyl chains (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

Another set of residues that appears important in controlling substrate selectivity lies near positions 211–215. Double mutations at M211 and R215 (M211S and R215L) have been found to alter substrate usage in EST2 toward longer acyl chains; in homologous enzymes such as Streptomyces EstA, the residue corresponding to W213 is similarly implicated, with mutations (e.g., W213R) leading to changes in substrate spectrum. This region thus seems to form part of the structural framework that directs substrate orientation and chain-length specificity (soror2007characterisationofesterase pages 117-122).

One of the most critical groups of residues is the catalytic triad, which in EST2 is generally understood to comprise a serine, an aspartate, and a histidine. For example, homology modeling studies on EST2 indicate that these correspond to Ser155, Asp252, and His282, where Ser155 is located within the conserved Gly‐X‐Ser‐X‐Gly “nucleophilic elbow” responsible for generating the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis, Asp252 serves to stabilize the histidine’s protonation state, and His282 acts as the general base that facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the ester substrate (manco1999homologymodelingand pages 1-2).

In parallel, structural studies of homologous enzymes such as AeCXE1 and TtEst2 demonstrate that while precise numbering may vary, the triad’s functional roles are universally conserved, underscoring their importance in catalysis across the α/β‐hydrolase fold family (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, sayer2015thestructureof pages 4-5).

Another group of residues that are highly conserved in EST2 and homologues are those lining the substrate binding pocket, where hydrophobic interactions play a dual role in both substrate stabilization and maintaining the integrity of the active site structure. In EST2, mutagenesis and comparative modeling studies have identified Leu205, Leu206, Met210, and Phe214 as key contributors to this hydrophobic environment; these nonpolar residues align to create a pocket that not only helps orient the incoming ester substrate but also maintains the proper conformation of the enzyme’s active site (liu2021proteinengineeringfor pages 9-13).

Furthermore, the stabilization of the transient oxyanion during the catalytic cycle is typically achieved by a set of backbone amides or specific side chains that form the oxyanion hole. Although the precise amino acid numbers for the oxyanion hole in EST2 are not exhaustively detailed in all studies, evidence from homologues, including AeCXE1, points to conserved glycine and alanine residues performing this function; these residues ensure that the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate is effectively neutralized, thereby facilitating catalysis (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15).

Overall, these conserved residues—the catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282), the substrate binding pocket hydrophobic residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214), and those that likely contribute to oxyanion stabilization—are essential not only for the chemical transformation of substrates but also for the structural integrity of the α/β‐hydrolase fold.

The catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282) ensures the direct chemical reactivity essential for ester hydrolysis, while the hydrophobic pocket residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214) and oxyanion hole components provide a robust structural framework that underpins enzyme stability under varied conditions (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15)."

One of the most critical groups of residues is the catalytic triad, which in EST2 is generally understood to comprise a serine, an aspartate, and a histidine. For example, homology modeling studies on EST2 indicate that these correspond to Ser155, Asp252, and His282, where Ser155 is located within the conserved Gly‐X‐Ser‐X‐Gly “nucleophilic elbow” responsible for generating the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis, Asp252 serves to stabilize the histidine’s protonation state, and His282 acts as the general base that facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the ester substrate (manco1999homologymodelingand pages 1-2).

In parallel, structural studies of homologous enzymes such as AeCXE1 and TtEst2 demonstrate that while precise numbering may vary, the triad’s functional roles are universally conserved, underscoring their importance in catalysis across the α/β‐hydrolase fold family (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, sayer2015thestructureof pages 4-5).

Another group of residues that are highly conserved in EST2 and homologues are those lining the substrate binding pocket, where hydrophobic interactions play a dual role in both substrate stabilization and maintaining the integrity of the active site structure. In EST2, mutagenesis and comparative modeling studies have identified Leu205, Leu206, Met210, and Phe214 as key contributors to this hydrophobic environment; these nonpolar residues align to create a pocket that not only helps orient the incoming ester substrate but also maintains the proper conformation of the enzyme’s active site (liu2021proteinengineeringfor pages 9-13).

Furthermore, the stabilization of the transient oxyanion during the catalytic cycle is typically achieved by a set of backbone amides or specific side chains that form the oxyanion hole. Although the precise amino acid numbers for the oxyanion hole in EST2 are not exhaustively detailed in all studies, evidence from homologues, including AeCXE1, points to conserved glycine and alanine residues performing this function; these residues ensure that the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate is effectively neutralized, thereby facilitating catalysis (ileperuma2007highresolutioncrystalstructure pages 4-5, oh2019carboxylicesterhydrolases pages 14-15).

Overall, these conserved residues—the catalytic triad (Ser155, Asp252, His282), the substrate binding pocket hydrophobic residues (Leu205, Leu206, Met210, Phe214), and those that likely contribute to oxyanion stabilization—are essential not only for the chemical transformation of substrates but also for the structural integrity of the α/β‐hydrolase fold.

Phytase PhyA ( Aspergillus niger ),3K4Q,A,C2,"C31 forms a disulfide bridge with C40, crucial for structural integrity and thermostability.","mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, vasudevan2019retractedthermostablephytase pages 5-6",literature,,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"The thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA, as represented by PDB entry 3K4Q chain A, is significantly influenced by several clusters of residues whose modification alters the enzyme’s melting temperature (Tm) and free energy of unfolding (ΔG°). Below is a detailed explanation of these key residues and the experimental or computational evidence supporting their roles:

1. Residues in the 35–42 Region (e.g., A35 and P42)  
Structural comparison and molecular dynamics studies have revealed that the segment spanning residues 35–42 is thermally sensitive. In one study, replacing the native ANESVISP sequence with the corresponding sequence EDELSVSS from a thermostable homolog resulted in improved thermostability. In particular, the substitution A35E introduces a negative charge that can augment hydrogen bonding, while the conversion of proline at position 42 to serine (P42S) increases local flexibility and potential for hydrogen bond formation. Moreover, complementary work identifies this same region—including Glu35 and Ser42—as forming stabilizing intra-protein interactions that directly correlate with enhanced thermostability (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3).

2. Disulfide Bridge Residues (C31 and C40)  
Cysteine residues C31 and C40, which form one of the five conserved disulfide bridges in PhyA, are fundamental for maintaining the enzyme’s three-dimensional structure. Experimental mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that modifications disrupting this disulfide bridge lead to altered optimal temperature profiles and improved residual activity after heat treatment. This indicates that while the disulfide bond contributes to structural integrity, its elimination or alteration can modulate the stability landscape, possibly by allowing structural rearrangements that favor heat tolerance (mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, vasudevan2019retractedthermostablephytase pages 5-6).

3. Residue I44  
Site-directed mutagenesis of residue I44, converting isoleucine to glutamic acid (I44E), creates a new salt bridge between the introduced glutamate and a neighboring arginine. This new electrostatic interaction stabilizes the local structure, thereby enhancing thermostability without compromising catalytic efficiency. The improvement in catalytic efficiency observed in the mutated PhyA underscores the dual benefit of this modification (liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, pages 13-15).

4. Residues A58 and P65  
Additional substitutions analogous to those identified in homologous thermostable enzymes include A58E and P65S. The A58E mutation introduces a charged residue that can participate in salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, while the P65S mutation replaces a rigid proline with a more flexible serine, facilitating the formation of stabilizing interactions. These mutations have been reported to increase the melting temperature by approximately 7 °C, signifying their substantial impact on protein rigidity and resistance to unfolding (noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, shivange2017recentadvancesin pages 16-19).

5. Residues in the 163–168 Region (e.g., Q168/Arg168)  
Within the second hotspot, residue Q168 is converted to arginine (Q168R) in the thermostable mutants. The introduction of a positively charged arginine fosters new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the enzyme’s tertiary structure under heat stress. This region’s role is further supported by structural analyses that demonstrate significant backbone shifts and interaction differences between less and more thermostable variants (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 3-4).

6. Residues in the 248–254 Region (e.g., T248 and T252)  
Lastly, modifications in the region encompassing residues 248–254 have also been shown to influence thermostability. The mutation T248R (and similarly, T252R as identified independently) replaces a threonine with an arginine, thereby increasing the capacity to form additional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Such substitutions help rigidify the structure and raise the unfolding energy barrier, resulting in enhanced thermal tolerance (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13).

In summary, the combined evidence supports that mutations at residues A35, P42, C31, C40, I44, A58, P65, Q168 (or Arg168), T248 (and T252) can modulate the thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA. These changes primarily work by reinforcing hydrogen bond networks, establishing new salt bridges, and in some cases, by modifying disulfide bridge connectivity, thereby affecting both the melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7)."

This new electrostatic interaction stabilizes the local structure, thereby enhancing thermostability without compromising catalytic efficiency. The improvement in catalytic efficiency observed in the mutated PhyA underscores the dual benefit of this modification (liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, pages 13-15).

4. Residues A58 and P65  
Additional substitutions analogous to those identified in homologous thermostable enzymes include A58E and P65S. The A58E mutation introduces a charged residue that can participate in salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, while the P65S mutation replaces a rigid proline with a more flexible serine, facilitating the formation of stabilizing interactions. These mutations have been reported to increase the melting temperature by approximately 7 °C, signifying their substantial impact on protein rigidity and resistance to unfolding (noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, shivange2017recentadvancesin pages 16-19).

5. Residues in the 163–168 Region (e.g., Q168/Arg168)  
Within the second hotspot, residue Q168 is converted to arginine (Q168R) in the thermostable mutants. The introduction of a positively charged arginine fosters new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the enzyme’s tertiary structure under heat stress. This region’s role is further supported by structural analyses that demonstrate significant backbone shifts and interaction differences between less and more thermostable variants (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 3-4).

6. Residues in the 248–254 Region (e.g., T248 and T252)  
Lastly, modifications in the region encompassing residues 248–254 have also been shown to influence thermostability. The mutation T248R (and similarly, T252R as identified independently) replaces a threonine with an arginine, thereby increasing the capacity to form additional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Such substitutions help rigidify the structure and raise the unfolding energy barrier, resulting in enhanced thermal tolerance (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13).

In summary, the combined evidence supports that mutations at residues A35, P42, C31, C40, I44, A58, P65, Q168 (or Arg168), T248 (and T252) can modulate the thermostability of Aspergillus niger PhyA. These changes primarily work by reinforcing hydrogen bond networks, establishing new salt bridges, and in some cases, by modifying disulfide bridge connectivity, thereby affecting both the melting temperature and ΔG° of unfolding (han2018enhancingthermaltolerance pages 1-2, liao2013sitedirectedmutagenesisimproves pages 10-13, noorbatcha2013understandingthermostabilityfactors pages 1-3, mullaney2012eliminationofa pages 1-2, kataria2021recentapplicationsof pages 7-7)."

Arg58, His59, and Arg62 lie within the hallmark motif. Arg58 and Arg62 are positively charged and play critical roles in engaging with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the substrate. Their function is twofold: they help to position the substrate within the active site by forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and they contribute to the stabilization of the transition state during catalysis (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 1-2, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13). His59, meanwhile, has been identified as the nucleophile that forms a phosphohistidine intermediate—a key step in the catalytic mechanism of histidine acid phosphatases (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13). This residue is critical both for its chemical reactivity and for maintaining the precise geometry of the active site.

Arg142 is also conserved and contributes to the electrostatic network that stabilizes the binding of the substrate, enhancing both specificity and catalytic efficiency. Its role, along with Arg58 and Arg62, underpins the essential salt bridge interactions that fortify the enzyme’s structural framework (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 1-2, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13).

His338 is another essential residue that has been implicated in ligand (and by extension, substrate) binding. Structural data indicate that His338 interacts with groups on the substrate that mimic its natural binding state, thereby contributing to both activity and the overall integrity of the active site (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, li2014structurefunctionstudiesof pages 60-65).

Finally, Asp339, located adjacent to His338, plays a pivotal role in the catalytic process by acting as a proton donor.

Its dual role in catalysis and in maintaining the active site structure underscores its importance (oakley2010thestructureof pages 2-3, ninogomez2017“insilico”characterization pages 12-13).

Beyond the immediate active site, other residues and salt bridge-forming pairs contribute to the structural stability of PhyA. For instance, salt bridges such as Asp335–Arg136 have been identified as crucial for thermal stability. These interactions help to anchor critical secondary structure elements (for example, beta-sheets and loops) that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the enzyme under thermal stress conditions (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 10-11, oakley2010thestructureof pages 3-4).

Additional salt bridges—such as Glu125–Arg163, Asp299–Arg136, Asp266–Arg219, and Asp339–Lys278—exhibit temperature-dependent variations, suggesting that they contribute to the fine-tuned balance between flexibility and rigidity in PhyA. This balance is essential not only for catalytic function but also for the enzyme’s overall structural endurance in varying thermal environments (kumar2015insightsintothe pages 10-11).

In summary, the residues Arg58, His59, Arg62, Arg142, His338, and Asp339 are highly conserved across phytase homologues and are integral to the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism and structural stability.

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H116,Acts as the initial proton acceptor in the proton transfer pathway.,blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"In T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A), several groups of conserved residues have been identified as essential for catalysis and biochemical regulation. In particular, three distinct sets of functionally critical residues can be delineated: those involved in proton transfer, those that directly coordinate the copper ions in the catalytic centers, and those forming a unique β‐hairpin regulatory motif.

First, a proton transfer network has been characterized that is unique to bacterial laccases compared to their fungal counterparts. In this system, His139 acts as the initial proton acceptor from the solvent. The proton is then passed via Asp452 to Glu451, which delivers the proton to the trinuclear copper center (TNC) through a Grotthuss mechanism. This relay mechanism is supported by multiple crystallographic structures of Tth-MCO, and sequence conservation among bacterial laccases suggests that these residues are critical not only for catalysis but also for the relatively lower overall enzymatic activity when compared to fungal laccases (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).

Second, as expected for multicopper oxidases, the catalytic function depends on proper coordination of copper ions at distinct sites. Although exact numbering for all copper-coordinating residues in 6Q29 chain A is not fully delineated across the provided excerpts, standard evidence from related studies consistently demonstrates that T1 copper is coordinated by two histidine residues and one cysteine (with a methionine sometimes acting as a fourth ligand). In this context, spectroscopic and inhibition data observed in studies of T. thermophilus laccases indicate that conserved histidine and cysteine residues are indispensable for binding copper and thus for electron transfer from the substrate to the TNC (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6). Additional evidence from related work involving T1 copper coordination points to His189 and His303 as key ligands that maintain the proper redox geometry required for catalytic activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Third, a distinct β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper site plays a regulatory role by modulating substrate access. This segment is structurally dynamic and functions as a pH‐dependent switch for enzymatic activity. Within this motif several methionine and histidine residues have been implicated in coordinating ancillary metal ions (e.g., Ag⁺ and Hg⁺) that are thought to regulate the catalytic cycle indirectly. Structural and molecular dynamics studies have identified residues such as Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 as essential for this regulation. These residues not only contribute to metal ion binding but also influence the conformational dynamics of the β‐hairpin, thereby controlling the exposure of the T1 copper site to substrates (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10). The coordinated motion of this motif correlates with shifts in enzyme activity under different pH conditions, making these residues critical for enzyme regulation.

In summary, the essential residues in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:
• His139, Asp452, and Glu451 – forming a proton relay pathway to the trinuclear copper center (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).
• Conserved T1 copper ligands such as His189 and His303 (likely along with a cysteine and sometimes a methionine) that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion, facilitating electron transfer (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).
• β‐hairpin motif residues – notably Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 – which modulate substrate access and regulate activity through pH‐dependent conformational changes (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In particular, three distinct sets of functionally critical residues can be delineated: those involved in proton transfer, those that directly coordinate the copper ions in the catalytic centers, and those forming a unique β‐hairpin regulatory motif.

First, a proton transfer network has been characterized that is unique to bacterial laccases compared to their fungal counterparts. In this system, His139 acts as the initial proton acceptor from the solvent. The proton is then passed via Asp452 to Glu451, which delivers the proton to the trinuclear copper center (TNC) through a Grotthuss mechanism. This relay mechanism is supported by multiple crystallographic structures of Tth-MCO, and sequence conservation among bacterial laccases suggests that these residues are critical not only for catalysis but also for the relatively lower overall enzymatic activity when compared to fungal laccases (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 71-76).

Second, as expected for multicopper oxidases, the catalytic function depends on proper coordination of copper ions at distinct sites. Although exact numbering for all copper-coordinating residues in 6Q29 chain A is not fully delineated across the provided excerpts, standard evidence from related studies consistently demonstrates that T1 copper is coordinated by two histidine residues and one cysteine (with a methionine sometimes acting as a fourth ligand). In this context, spectroscopic and inhibition data observed in studies of T. thermophilus laccases indicate that conserved histidine and cysteine residues are indispensable for binding copper and thus for electron transfer from the substrate to the TNC (kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 3-4, kim2015expressionrefoldingand pages 6-6). Additional evidence from related work involving T1 copper coordination points to His189 and His303 as key ligands that maintain the proper redox geometry required for catalytic activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Third, a distinct β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper site plays a regulatory role by modulating substrate access. This segment is structurally dynamic and functions as a pH‐dependent switch for enzymatic activity. Within this motif several methionine and histidine residues have been implicated in coordinating ancillary metal ions (e.g., Ag⁺ and Hg⁺) that are thought to regulate the catalytic cycle indirectly. Structural and molecular dynamics studies have identified residues such as Met298, Met301, His303, and Met305 as essential for this regulation. These residues not only contribute to metal ion binding but also influence the conformational dynamics of the β‐hairpin, thereby controlling the exposure of the T1 copper site to substrates (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H166,Key histidine modulating β-hairpin conformation via pH-dependent protonation.,mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available structural and simulation data indicate that the pH‐dependent allosteric regulation and conformational switching observed in the T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) are mediated predominantly by residues within a unique, methionine‐rich β‐hairpin that is located close to the T1 copper site. Multiple independent studies provide convergent evidence for the involvement of both polar/charged and hydrophobic (methionine) residues in modulating the mobility of this region in response to environmental conditions.

One set of residues comprises key histidines residing at the base of the β‐hairpin. In particular, His189 and His303 have been implicated as critical actors. Their protonation states are sensitive to pH, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that changes in their electrostatic environment correlate with the conformational transitions of the β‐hairpin (switching between open and closed states). Such pH‐dependent variations are proposed to alter the relative positioning of the β‐hairpin with respect to the T1 copper site, thereby controlling substrate access and enzyme activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

A second group of residues involves the methionine side chains that populate the β‐hairpin. Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;

• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;
• Clusters of methionine residues (notably M192, M195, M292, M296, M301, M305, M354, M355, and M391) that form transient metal‐binding sites and influence structural mobility;
• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Each of these residues, by contributing to either direct interactions or modulating the local electrostatic landscape, plays a role in the allosteric regulation of laccase activity via conformational switching (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10, blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90)."

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,D367,Charged residue modulating electrostatic environment affecting β-hairpin conformation.,mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"The available structural and simulation data indicate that the pH‐dependent allosteric regulation and conformational switching observed in the T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) are mediated predominantly by residues within a unique, methionine‐rich β‐hairpin that is located close to the T1 copper site. Multiple independent studies provide convergent evidence for the involvement of both polar/charged and hydrophobic (methionine) residues in modulating the mobility of this region in response to environmental conditions.

One set of residues comprises key histidines residing at the base of the β‐hairpin. In particular, His189 and His303 have been implicated as critical actors. Their protonation states are sensitive to pH, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that changes in their electrostatic environment correlate with the conformational transitions of the β‐hairpin (switching between open and closed states). Such pH‐dependent variations are proposed to alter the relative positioning of the β‐hairpin with respect to the T1 copper site, thereby controlling substrate access and enzyme activity (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

A second group of residues involves the methionine side chains that populate the β‐hairpin. Although several studies list slightly different sets of methionines depending on their criteria for defining distinct metal‐binding clusters, there is consistent evidence that multiple methionine residues (organized in three clusters) participate in the conformational switching mechanism by forming transient metal‐binding sites. One study reports three principal Ag⁺ binding clusters formed by (M195, M354, M391), (M192, M296, M355), and (M292, M301, M305) respectively. These methionine residues, by coordinating soft metal ions under oxidative conditions, appear to contribute to the structural integrity and dynamic flexibility of the β‐hairpin, even though direct metal binding is not the sole driver of the allosteric regulation (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

In addition to the residues that are intrinsic to the β‐hairpin motif, charged residues in its vicinity have also been noted to modulate electrostatic surface potentials that, in turn, influence the β‐hairpin’s conformation. Specifically, Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442 exhibit pH‐dependent protonation changes. Such alterations may affect the overall electrostatic environment, driving the transition between open and closed states of the β‐hairpin and thereby modulating access to the T1 copper catalytic center (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8).

Finally, other studies (via crystallographic analyses) have highlighted the importance of nearby histidines (such as His350 and His458) that, although primarily associated with copper binding at other sites (e.g., near the T5 copper site), reinforce the concept that clusters of polar and sulfur‐containing residues collectively contribute to the fine tuning of enzyme activity through allosteric mechanisms (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90).

Thus, the cumulative evidence supports that the β‐hairpin in PDB 6Q29 chain A functions as a dynamic, pH‐sensitive regulatory element. Its allosteric control is mediated by:
• Key histidines (His189 and His303) whose pH‐dependent protonation modulates the β‐hairpin’s conformation;
• Clusters of methionine residues (notably M192, M195, M292, M296, M301, M305, M354, M355, and M391) that form transient metal‐binding sites and influence structural mobility;
• Additional charged residues (Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442) that affect the electrostatic properties surrounding the β‐hairpin.

Each of these residues, by contributing to either direct interactions or modulating the local electrostatic landscape, plays a role in the allosteric regulation of laccase activity via conformational switching (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10, blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 87-90)."

The T1Cu site is coordinated by His393, His450, and Cys445, which are essential for electron transfer during substrate oxidation. These residues not only stabilize the T1Cu center but also create the redox environment required for catalysis, thereby directly influencing substrate interaction and specificity (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 22-25).

In addition to the primary copper ligands, the β‐hairpin region—which acts as a regulatory switch—plays a major role in modulating substrate access to the T1Cu site. In the open conformation, as observed in the 6Q29 structure, the β‐hairpin enlarges the substrate‐binding cavity, thereby facilitating substrate access. Within this β‐hairpin, residues His189 and His303 are particularly significant. Their protonation states change with pH and directly affect the conformation of the β‐hairpin, which in turn regulates the size of the cavity available for substrate binding (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6).

There is also evidence supporting the role of conserved methionine residues in the β‐hairpin region. For instance, a cluster of methionines—such as M298, M301, and M305—is arranged in a manner that suggests they may form auxiliary metal‐binding sites. Although these methionine residues are not the primary ligands for the catalytic copper ions, they may contribute indirectly to substrate specificity by stabilizing the overall conformation of the substrate‐binding pocket through metal coordination and structural anchoring. This dynamic metal binding is hypothesized to fine‐tune the electrostatic and steric environment around the active site (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 10-10).

The pH‐dependent movement of the β‐hairpin is critical because it functions as a molecular gate that alternates between open and closed states. At acidic pH, the open conformation increases the solvent-accessible surface area near the T1Cu site and enhances substrate binding, as indicated by the increased cavity area measured in the open state (approximately 295.7 Å²). This gating mechanism is controlled by the interplay of protonation states of histidine residues—including those mentioned above—and the overall flexibility of the β‐hairpin, thereby directly impacting the enzyme’s substrate specificity and turnover (mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6).

Thus, the integrated mechanism of ligand recognition and specificity in PDB 6Q29 chain A involves (1) direct coordination of the T1Cu by His393, His450, and Cys445, which is essential for substrate oxidation and electron transfer; and (2) a dynamic β‐hairpin region, where residues His189 and His303 regulate access to the T1Cu site via pH-dependent conformational changes, supported in part by a cluster of methionine residues that may modulate the local metal environment and structural integrity of the substrate-binding pocket (blancas2021análisisestructuralde pages 22-25, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 4-6)."
Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,H373,Primary copper ligand coordinating the T1 copper ion.,Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The laccase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 6Q29 chain A) exhibits several highly conserved residues among its homologues that are integral to both its catalytic function and structural stability.

One set of key residues is found within the type‐1 (T1) copper site. Experimental and mutational studies identify His397, Cys450, and His455 as the primary copper ligands that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion. In addition, the axial ligand—Met460—plays a crucial role in tuning the redox potential and electron transfer efficiency. Mutation studies have shown that substituting the axial ligand can markedly alter enzymatic performance, underscoring its functional importance (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Sequence alignment and mutagenesis work also highlight conserved copper‐binding residues near the T1 site. For example, His444, His450, and Met455 (noting slight numbering differences common in homologues) are conserved across bacterial and fungal laccases. Although residue Arg453 in the wild‐type enzyme is not strictly conserved in all homologues, its mutation to threonine (R453T) improved catalytic activity and pH stability without disrupting copper incorporation or overall protein folding. This finding indicates that, while the arginine’s conservation is unique, the surrounding copper‐binding microenvironment constituted by His444, His450, and Met455 is a hallmark of T1 site structural integrity (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).

Beyond the immediate T1 copper ligands, second-sphere residues also contribute to the enzyme’s performance by modulating hydrogen-bond networks and the spatial arrangement of the trinuclear copper cluster. Conserved acidic residues such as Asp106 and Glu456 have been shown to affect the copper-copper distances and, as a result, the kinetics and stability of the enzyme. Their role in establishing finely tuned electrostatic interactions adjacent to the active sites emphasizes their importance not only for catalytic efficiency but also for maintaining structural stability under thermal stress (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

A further structural element is the β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper center. In Thermus thermophilus laccase, this region contains a cluster of conserved methionine residues (notably M292, M295, M298, M301, and M305) along with the conserved His303. The β‐hairpin functions as a pH-dependent switch, regulating substrate access and overall activity by undergoing conformational changes linked to protonation states. Additional conserved acidic residues in and around this motif, such as Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442, contribute to the electrostatic landscape that modulates β‐hairpin dynamics and, ultimately, substrate binding and electron transfer events (Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10).

Finally, broader analyses of thermostability in laccases from T. thermophilus indicate that other conserved residues—often involved in disulfide bonding (cysteines), hydrogen bonding (threonines), and hydrophobic interactions (phenylalanines)—support the overall structural framework of the enzyme. These residues help maintain the integrity of the cupredoxin-like β-barrel domains and ensure that the active site remains properly configured under extreme conditions (Tiwari2024precisionthermostabilitypredictions pages 11-13, Dwivedi2011structure–functionrelationshipamong pages 5-8).

In summary, the most critical conserved residues found in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:

• T1 copper site ligands: His397, Cys450, His455, and axial ligand Met460 (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Laccase ( T. thermophilus ),6Q29,A,E244,Acidic residue modulating β-hairpin dynamics and substrate binding.,Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8,literature,,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"The laccase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 6Q29 chain A) exhibits several highly conserved residues among its homologues that are integral to both its catalytic function and structural stability.

One set of key residues is found within the type‐1 (T1) copper site. Experimental and mutational studies identify His397, Cys450, and His455 as the primary copper ligands that directly coordinate the T1 copper ion. In addition, the axial ligand—Met460—plays a crucial role in tuning the redox potential and electron transfer efficiency. Mutation studies have shown that substituting the axial ligand can markedly alter enzymatic performance, underscoring its functional importance (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).

Sequence alignment and mutagenesis work also highlight conserved copper‐binding residues near the T1 site. For example, His444, His450, and Met455 (noting slight numbering differences common in homologues) are conserved across bacterial and fungal laccases. Although residue Arg453 in the wild‐type enzyme is not strictly conserved in all homologues, its mutation to threonine (R453T) improved catalytic activity and pH stability without disrupting copper incorporation or overall protein folding. This finding indicates that, while the arginine’s conservation is unique, the surrounding copper‐binding microenvironment constituted by His444, His450, and Met455 is a hallmark of T1 site structural integrity (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).

Beyond the immediate T1 copper ligands, second-sphere residues also contribute to the enzyme’s performance by modulating hydrogen-bond networks and the spatial arrangement of the trinuclear copper cluster. Conserved acidic residues such as Asp106 and Glu456 have been shown to affect the copper-copper distances and, as a result, the kinetics and stability of the enzyme. Their role in establishing finely tuned electrostatic interactions adjacent to the active sites emphasizes their importance not only for catalytic efficiency but also for maintaining structural stability under thermal stress (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

A further structural element is the β‐hairpin motif near the T1 copper center. In Thermus thermophilus laccase, this region contains a cluster of conserved methionine residues (notably M292, M295, M298, M301, and M305) along with the conserved His303. The β‐hairpin functions as a pH-dependent switch, regulating substrate access and overall activity by undergoing conformational changes linked to protonation states. Additional conserved acidic residues in and around this motif, such as Glu267, Glu352, Asp392, and Asp442, contribute to the electrostatic landscape that modulates β‐hairpin dynamics and, ultimately, substrate binding and electron transfer events (Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 6-8, Mirandablancas2021theβhairpinfrom pages 8-10).

Finally, broader analyses of thermostability in laccases from T. thermophilus indicate that other conserved residues—often involved in disulfide bonding (cysteines), hydrogen bonding (threonines), and hydrophobic interactions (phenylalanines)—support the overall structural framework of the enzyme. These residues help maintain the integrity of the cupredoxin-like β-barrel domains and ensure that the active site remains properly configured under extreme conditions (Tiwari2024precisionthermostabilitypredictions pages 11-13, Dwivedi2011structure–functionrelationshipamong pages 5-8).

In summary, the most critical conserved residues found in T. thermophilus laccase (PDB 6Q29 chain A) include:

• T1 copper site ligands: His397, Cys450, His455, and axial ligand Met460 (Zhu2019axialbondsat pages 1-2).  
• Adjacent conserved residues in the T1 environment: His444, His450, Met455 along with the modulatory role of Arg453 (Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 5-7, Liu2012sitedirectedmutationof pages 7-8).  
• Second-sphere acidic residues: Asp106 and Glu456, which fine-tune the active site geometry and hydrogen bonding (Liu2018foursecondsphereresidues pages 1-10).

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,W263,Critical for thermostability and active site loop rigidity; mutations decrease Tm and enzyme function.,"Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 132-133, suzumoto2020structuralandfunctional pages 14-16",literature,W262A;W262F;W262Y,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,"The evidence indicates that a few key residues in SsoPox lactonase (PDB 3UF9 chain A) have a measurable impact on thermostability, primarily by altering the melting temperature (Tm) or the unfolding free energy (ΔG°).

One of the most critical residues is tryptophan at position 263 (W263). Multiple mutagenesis studies demonstrated that any substitution at this position consistently decreases the overall protein thermostability. W263 is located on loop 8, where it plays a dual role in forming part of the active site and contributing to the dimer interface. Mutations at this site lead to increased loop flexibility, which correlates with a significant drop in Tm and perturbed enzyme function. The evidence shows that the stability of loop 8 hinges on the presence of W263, as substitutions here dramatically shift the balance between rigidity (necessary for high thermostability) and the flexibility required for catalytic promiscuity (Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 132-133, suzumoto2020structuralandfunctional pages 14-16).

In addition to W263, residues at positions 14 and 34 also affect thermostability. SsoPox naturally contains Lys14 (K14) and Tyr34 (Y34), which contrast with the corresponding residues in the closely related SisLac enzyme. Mutagenesis studies that mimic the SsoPox residues in SisLac show that an E14K change (mimicking the SsoPox K14) and a Y34Q change (mimicking the SsoPox Y34) affect the protein’s thermal profile. Independent mutations at these positions in SisLac resulted in decreases in melting temperature of approximately 6°C for E14K and 8°C for Y34Q. Interestingly, a double mutant combining both changes showed partial recuperation of Tm, which is interpreted as evidence of epistatic interactions influencing the stability of the dimer interface. These findings underscore the importance of the specific charge and hydrogen-bonding properties at positions 14 and 34 in maintaining a robust structure at elevated temperatures (Gotthard2013caractérisationstructuraledenzymes pages 84-85, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 12-13).

Structural comparisons and further mutational studies on SsoPox also indicate that the overall network of surface-exposed charged residues contributes substantially to thermostability. Although no single mutation was exclusively highlighted in this context, several charged residues participate in salt bridge networks that stabilize the protein structure. For instance, the formation of a salt bridge between the terminal carboxyl group of Ser314 and the guanidinium group of Arg2, along with the presence of rigidifying prolines (Pro4 and Pro309), contributes to the high Tm observed for SsoPox. Such inter-residue interactions are critical to reduce the overall solvent accessibility and maintain the integrity of the dimer interface, thereby resisting thermal denaturation. These factors are supported by structural analyses that correlate the density of salt bridges with increased thermostability (Mandrich2010hyperthermophilicphosphotriesteraseslactonasesfor pages 7-9).

In summary, the experimental mutagenesis and structural studies point to W263 as a central residue modulating the flexibility of an essential active site loop and directly impacting Tm. In addition, the dimer interface residues K14 and Y34 are vital for achieving optimal thermostability, possibly through their influence on charged interactions and interface organization. Finally, the broader network of salt bridges involving residues like Arg2, Ser314, Pro4, and Pro309 further reinforces the thermostable architecture of SsoPox."

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,H22,Coordinates the α-site metal ion for catalysis.,"elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The enzyme SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) requires several key residues for its catalytic and substrate‐binding functions. These residues can be divided into those that coordinate the binuclear metal center essential for nucleophile activation and those that mediate substrate positioning and active‐site dynamics.

First, the integrity of the binuclear metal center is maintained by six conserved residues. His22 and His24 act as ligands that coordinate the α‐site metal ion, establishing one of the two metal-binding sites necessary for catalysis (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33). Similarly, His170 and His199 participate in binding the β‐site metal ion, ensuring proper geometry and activation of the bridging water molecule. This water, which becomes a hydroxide nucleophile during catalysis, is further stabilized by Asp256, a residue strategically positioned to interact with the bridging hydroxide and polarize the substrate’s carbonyl group (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, pages 7-10). In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10).

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,H22,Coordinates the α-site metal ion for catalysis.,"elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The enzyme SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) requires several key residues for its catalytic and substrate‐binding functions. These residues can be divided into those that coordinate the binuclear metal center essential for nucleophile activation and those that mediate substrate positioning and active‐site dynamics.

First, the integrity of the binuclear metal center is maintained by six conserved residues. His22 and His24 act as ligands that coordinate the α‐site metal ion, establishing one of the two metal-binding sites necessary for catalysis (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33). Similarly, His170 and His199 participate in binding the β‐site metal ion, ensuring proper geometry and activation of the bridging water molecule. This water, which becomes a hydroxide nucleophile during catalysis, is further stabilized by Asp256, a residue strategically positioned to interact with the bridging hydroxide and polarize the substrate’s carbonyl group (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, pages 7-10). In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10).

In addition, a carboxylated lysine (Lys137) serves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions, reinforcing the structural integrity of the active site and contributing to the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33).

Beyond metal coordination, substrate binding and orientation are principally mediated by several aromatic and charged residues. Tyr97 is one of the most critical residues for lactonase activity. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the lactone substrate, positioning the substrate for efficient nucleophilic attack by the activated hydroxide. Mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutation to a tryptophan (Y97W) can even enhance activity, underscore the importance of both the precise positioning and the hydrogen bonding capability of Tyr97 (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 112-117, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29). Tyr194, although not as intensively studied as Tyr97, appears to perform a similar function in stabilizing substrate binding by helping orient the lactone ring above the metal center (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7).

Arg223 has been implicated in substrate binding as well. In structural and mutagenesis studies, substitution of Arg223 (for instance, to histidine) resulted in a substantial drop in both lactonase and paraoxonase activities. This indicates that Arg223 is significant in correctly orienting the substrate within the active site, possibly by stabilizing the negative charge that develops during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 5-7, langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92, ng2009expressionandpurification pages 35-38).

In addition to these residues, W263, located at the beginning of loop 8, is essential for modulating active site dynamics. W263 helps form the hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of the substrate and governs the flexibility of loop 8. Changes at this position through mutation (e.g., W263T, W263V) have been shown to dramatically improve catalytic efficiency for oxo-lactonase as well as phosphotriesterase activities by altering the conformation and accessibility of the active site (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

There is also evidence that Cys258 may participate functionally, potentially by providing a proton to the leaving group during catalysis, although its exact role requires further investigation (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 7-10). Finally, L226, which helps form the hydrophobic channel adjacent to the active site, influences substrate specificity by affecting acyl chain binding without being directly involved in catalysis (langley2011investigationofthe pages 86-92).

In summary, the catalytic efficiency and specificity of SsoPox arise from an integrated network of residues: His22, His24, His170, His199, Asp256, and carboxylated Lys137 maintain the metal center needed for hydroxide activation; Tyr97 (with supportive roles for Tyr194) and Arg223 facilitate substrate orientation and stabilization of intermediates; while W263 in loop 8 modulates active site conformation, and Cys258 and L226 contribute to substrate interactions. These conclusions are supported by structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis studies reported in multiple independent sources (elias2008structuralbasisfor pages 2-3, 5-7, 7-10; hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, 9-9; langley2011investigationofthe pages 26-33, 86-92; ng2009expressionandpurification pages 23-29, 35-38)."

First, the aromatic residue tryptophan at position 263 (W263) stands out as the central mediator of conformational switching. Multiple mutagenesis studies showed that substituting W263 with a variety of amino acids (F, L, M, I, V, T) leads to marked differences in loop 8 conformations, which in turn affect substrate binding and catalytic promiscuity. These substitutions cause altered normalized B-factors in residues 250–285, a change that correlates with significant variations in phosphotriesterase and lactonase activities. The disruptive effect of mutations at W263 is not solely due to chemical changes at the active site, but rather through inducing alternative structural ensembles that control the dynamics of the enzyme’s active site loop. In other words, W263 functions as a critical switch whose altered flexibility is directly responsible for the modulation of substrate specificity and enzyme efficiency (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 3-4, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9).

A second residue implicated in the regulation of conformational switching is found at position 34. In SsoPox, residue 34 is a glutamine (Q34), which participates in hydrogen bonding across the dimer interface. Structural comparisons between SsoPox and its close homolog SisLac reveal that position 34 plays a pivotal role in intermonomer contacts. In SsoPox, the presence of Q34 ensures a specific dimer orientation that indirectly influences the conformation of the loops near the active site. Perturbations at this site—evidenced by mutagenesis in related proteins—demonstrate a reduction in catalytic efficiency and stability. This indicates that Q34 may act in an allosteric manner by propagating structural changes from the dimer interface to the active site cleft, thus modulating enzymatic function (hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 9-11, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 11-12).

A third candidate residue is located at position 14. In SsoPox, this residue is a lysine (K14) that forms part of an extensive network of salt bridges and electrostatic interactions near the dimer interface. Although its primary role is in maintaining protein rigidity and stability, K14 affects the local conformation of the dimer interface and, by extension, the active site environment. Analyses of the corresponding mutations in homologous lactonases indicate that even subtle changes in these charged residues can alter melting temperature and catalytic performance, suggesting an indirect allosteric contribution. By influencing the strength and pattern of its electrostatic interactions, K14 is well positioned to participate in the conformational switching processes that adjust substrate access or product release (hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 8-9, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 11-12).

In summary, the cumulative evidence supports that W263 directly modulates active site loop flexibility and is essential for the enzyme’s promiscuous activity, while Q34 and K14 serve significant roles in controlling dimer interactions and stability, which in turn affect the overall conformation of the active site. Together, these residues effectively mediate allosteric regulatory mechanisms and conformational switching in SsoPox (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 1-2, hiblot2012structuralandenzymatic pages 9-11)."

SsoPox lactonase,3UF9,A,Y97,Key role in hydrogen-bond formation with active site water for substrate positioning.,hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6,literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The structural and biochemical data for SsoPox (PDB 3UF9 chain A) reveal that three residues stand out as major determinants for ligand and substrate binding as well as specificity: tyrosine 97 (Y97), tryptophan 263 (W263), and arginine 223 (R223).

Y97 is located in the active site near the bi‐metallic center. Its hydroxyl group plays a key role in hydrogen‐bond formation with an active site water molecule coordinated by the more exposed β-metal (commonly cobalt in SsoPox). This hydrogen bond is critical because it helps to position the lactone ring of the substrate optimally for catalysis. The conservation of Y97 among phosphotriesterase‐like lactonases (PLLs) and metallo-β-lactamases further underscores its essential role in ligand recognition and binding specificity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

W263 is positioned at the beginning of loop 8, which forms a hydrophobic channel critical for accommodating the aliphatic acyl chain of lactones. Structural and mutagenesis studies have shown that W263 not only directly interacts with substrate molecules but also plays an important role in modulating the conformational flexibility of loop 8. Mutations at this residue (e.g., to leucine, threonine, or other residues) have been demonstrated to reshape the active site cavity, thereby altering substrate preference and catalytic promiscuity. These findings underscore the pivotal role of W263 in determining which ligands can be bound effectively and in dictating the dynamic properties of the binding groove (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-11).

R223 contributes to the structural definition of the substrate‐binding pocket by interacting electrostatically with the substrate or inhibitor molecules. Although not always directly engaging the substrate in all binding modes, R223 influences the steric environment of the active site. Its side chain is positioned such that it can provide additional interactions—through either direct hydrogen bonding or electrostatic contacts—that help stabilize productive substrate orientations over non-productive ones. The presence of R223 is associated with the enzyme’s relatively small sub‐site size compared to classical phosphotriesterases (PTEs), which is reflected in the high KM values observed for larger phosphotriester substrates (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2016currentandemerging pages 11-13).

Together, these residues illustrate an interdependent network where Y97 anchors substrates via a critical water-mediated hydrogen bond, W263 shapes the active site by dictating loop 8 flexibility and substrate access, and R223 helps fine-tune space and charge complementarity. Their roles are supported by both crystallographic data (e.g., from the structure PDB 3UF9) and complementary kinetic studies that show how mutations at these positions alter enzymatic activity and substrate turnover. This integrated view is key not only for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SsoPox but also for guiding future protein engineering efforts aimed at enhancing its promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, jacquet2016currentandemerging pages 11-13)."

Y97 is located in the active site near the bi‐metallic center. Its hydroxyl group plays a key role in hydrogen‐bond formation with an active site water molecule coordinated by the more exposed β-metal (commonly cobalt in SsoPox). This hydrogen bond is critical because it helps to position the lactone ring of the substrate optimally for catalysis. The conservation of Y97 among phosphotriesterase‐like lactonases (PLLs) and metallo-β-lactamases further underscores its essential role in ligand recognition and binding specificity (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

W263 is positioned at the beginning of loop 8, which forms a hydrophobic channel critical for accommodating the aliphatic acyl chain of lactones. Structural and mutagenesis studies have shown that W263 not only directly interacts with substrate molecules but also plays an important role in modulating the conformational flexibility of loop 8. Mutations at this residue (e.g., to leucine, threonine, or other residues) have been demonstrated to reshape the active site cavity, thereby altering substrate preference and catalytic promiscuity. These findings underscore the pivotal role of W263 in determining which ligands can be bound effectively and in dictating the dynamic properties of the binding groove (hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-9, hiblot2013differentialactivesite pages 9-11).

R223 contributes to the structural definition of the substrate‐binding pocket by interacting electrostatically with the substrate or inhibitor molecules. Although not always directly engaging the substrate in all binding modes, R223 influences the steric environment of the active site. Its side chain is positioned such that it can provide additional interactions—through either direct hydrogen bonding or electrostatic contacts—that help stabilize productive substrate orientations over non-productive ones.

Each residue is discussed along with the supporting evidence from the literature excerpts.

One major residue repeatedly highlighted is tryptophan 263 (W263). Located within active site loop 8—a region that modulates both substrate binding and the orientation between enzyme monomers—W263 is conserved across homologues and has been shown to play a key role in regulating loop flexibility. Mutagenesis studies indicate that substitutions at W263 dramatically alter phosphotriesterase activity by reshaping the active site architecture without a total loss of lactonase function. This underscores its dual role in structural integrity (through stabilizing loop 8 dynamics) and catalytic efficiency (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 3-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5).

Tyrosine 97 (Y97) is another residue that is highly conserved among PLL enzymes. Y97 is positioned in the active site where it participates in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that is coordinated by one of the binuclear metal centers. This interaction is critical for proper substrate orientation during lactone hydrolysis. Mutation experiments reinforcing its importance show that altering Y97 affects both substrate binding and catalysis, further linking Y97 to the enzyme’s catalytic function and stability (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8).

Arginine 223 (R223) also emerges as an important residue. In SsoPox, R223 is analogous to a histidine found in related organophosphate hydrolases (specifically His254 in OPH), and studies have indicated that substitutions at this position (or its counterparts) lead to a significant decrease in catalytic activity against paraoxon. This functional link suggests that R223 is critical for the proper formation of the metal-coordinating environment and overall substrate positioning (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13, hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

Leucine 226 (L226) is also consistently mentioned as a conserved residue. It corresponds to His257 in OPH and plays a role in shaping the active site geometry. Changes at this residue are linked to alterations in catalytic efficiency, particularly with respect to the paraoxon substrate, thus indicating its contribution to both catalytic specificity and stability of the active center (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13).

In addition to the aforementioned catalytic residues, valine 27 (V27) has been identified as contributing to enzyme stability and substrate access. Located at the periphery of the active site cavity, substitutions such as V27A have been employed in engineering efforts to increase loop mobility and expand the active site, thereby modulating substrate selectivity while preserving overall structural integrity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Other residues, including leucine 228 (L228) and tyrosine 99 (Y99), appear in mutational studies aimed at enlarging the active site pocket. L228 is part of the loop region adjacent to W263 and contributes to the formation of a proper substrate binding platform, while Y99 is involved in forming the hydrophobic channel that accommodates lactone substrates.

Located within active site loop 8—a region that modulates both substrate binding and the orientation between enzyme monomers—W263 is conserved across homologues and has been shown to play a key role in regulating loop flexibility. Mutagenesis studies indicate that substitutions at W263 dramatically alter phosphotriesterase activity by reshaping the active site architecture without a total loss of lactonase function. This underscores its dual role in structural integrity (through stabilizing loop 8 dynamics) and catalytic efficiency (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 3-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5).

Tyrosine 97 (Y97) is another residue that is highly conserved among PLL enzymes. Y97 is positioned in the active site where it participates in hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that is coordinated by one of the binuclear metal centers. This interaction is critical for proper substrate orientation during lactone hydrolysis. Mutation experiments reinforcing its importance show that altering Y97 affects both substrate binding and catalysis, further linking Y97 to the enzyme’s catalytic function and stability (hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8).

Arginine 223 (R223) also emerges as an important residue. In SsoPox, R223 is analogous to a histidine found in related organophosphate hydrolases (specifically His254 in OPH), and studies have indicated that substitutions at this position (or its counterparts) lead to a significant decrease in catalytic activity against paraoxon. This functional link suggests that R223 is critical for the proper formation of the metal-coordinating environment and overall substrate positioning (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13, hiblot2012characterisationofthe pages 6-6).

Leucine 226 (L226) is also consistently mentioned as a conserved residue. It corresponds to His257 in OPH and plays a role in shaping the active site geometry. Changes at this residue are linked to alterations in catalytic efficiency, particularly with respect to the paraoxon substrate, thus indicating its contribution to both catalytic specificity and stability of the active center (lyagin2021enzymesreactingwith pages 9-13).

In addition to the aforementioned catalytic residues, valine 27 (V27) has been identified as contributing to enzyme stability and substrate access. Located at the periphery of the active site cavity, substitutions such as V27A have been employed in engineering efforts to increase loop mobility and expand the active site, thereby modulating substrate selectivity while preserving overall structural integrity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 7-8, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Other residues, including leucine 228 (L228) and tyrosine 99 (Y99), appear in mutational studies aimed at enlarging the active site pocket. L228 is part of the loop region adjacent to W263 and contributes to the formation of a proper substrate binding platform, while Y99 is involved in forming the hydrophobic channel that accommodates lactone substrates. Their conservation across homologues and deliberate targeting in engineering experiments indicate that these residues are critical for both maintaining structure and dictating substrate specificity (jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 3-5, jacquet2017rationalengineeringof pages 8-11).

Collectively, the evidence from kinetic analyses, crystallographic structures, and targeted mutagenesis supports that residues W263, Y97, R223, L226, V27, along with L228 and Y99, are highly conserved elements in SsoPox lactonase that govern both its catalytic function and structural stability."

One critical set of residues is Cys47 and Cys202, which form intersubunit disulfide bridges that stabilize the tetrameric assembly of TaCA. These disulfide bonds increase the melting temperature (Tm) and reduce the unfolding free energy (ΔG° of unfolding) by reducing conformational fluctuations, as evidenced by crystallographic and thermal stability analyses (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9).

Mutational studies have identified N140 as an important residue; alteration of this residue (e.g., the N140G mutation) dramatically enhanced thermostability, with the mutant retaining full activity after high‑temperature incubation. This finding underscores that local sequence flexibility around residue 140 is critical for maintaining rigidity at elevated temperatures (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 14-19).

Residue T175 is another site where proline substitution (T175P) has been introduced to rigidify flexible loop regions. Although this mutation confers moderate improvement in thermostability by decreasing local entropy, it must be optimally balanced because modifications in this region can shift the stability profile with temperature (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

In contrast, mutation at residue A242 (e.g., to proline, A242P) resulted in a reduction of stability, indicating that the natural alanine plays an essential role in maintaining an optimal flexible–rigid balance; thus, residue A242 is critical for preserving the native thermodynamic properties (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Furthermore, residues P165 and Q170 have been targeted for engineering de novo disulfide bonds. When these residues are mutated to cysteine (P165C and Q170C), the resulting covalent linkage adds rigidity to the protein structure, leading to an increased melting temperature and enhanced stability by effectively reducing the local unfolding rate (jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Residue C67 has also been implicated in thermostability. Interestingly, the mutation from C67 to glycine (C67G) was found to increase thermostability by alleviating potential steric or binding constraints imposed by the native disulfide bond at this position, highlighting its complex role in both substrate binding and structural rigidity (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Although the specific study on T. ammonificans CA does not list all the surface residues directly, analogous studies on related carbonic anhydrases indicate that strategic mutations to enhance salt-bridge networks can significantly alter thermostability. In particular, mutagenesis studies on mesophilic carbonic anhydrases using mutations such as S44R, S139E, and K168R have demonstrated that the introduction of new salt bridges increases rigidity, reduces the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and consequently elevates melting temperatures. Their role as charged residues in forming a stabilizing network supports a similar mechanism in naturally thermostable enzymes like T. ammonificans CA (bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19).

Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,C45,C67G mutation increased thermostability by alleviating steric constraints.,parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14,literature,C66G,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"The thermostability of the T. ammonificans carbonic anhydrase (CA) in pdb 4C3T chain A is influenced by several key residues that act either by forming strong intersubunit interactions or by modulating local flexibility and rigidity within the enzyme’s structure.

One critical set of residues is Cys47 and Cys202, which form intersubunit disulfide bridges that stabilize the tetrameric assembly of TaCA. These disulfide bonds increase the melting temperature (Tm) and reduce the unfolding free energy (ΔG° of unfolding) by reducing conformational fluctuations, as evidenced by crystallographic and thermal stability analyses (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9).

Mutational studies have identified N140 as an important residue; alteration of this residue (e.g., the N140G mutation) dramatically enhanced thermostability, with the mutant retaining full activity after high‑temperature incubation. This finding underscores that local sequence flexibility around residue 140 is critical for maintaining rigidity at elevated temperatures (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 14-19).

Residue T175 is another site where proline substitution (T175P) has been introduced to rigidify flexible loop regions. Although this mutation confers moderate improvement in thermostability by decreasing local entropy, it must be optimally balanced because modifications in this region can shift the stability profile with temperature (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

In contrast, mutation at residue A242 (e.g., to proline, A242P) resulted in a reduction of stability, indicating that the natural alanine plays an essential role in maintaining an optimal flexible–rigid balance; thus, residue A242 is critical for preserving the native thermodynamic properties (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Furthermore, residues P165 and Q170 have been targeted for engineering de novo disulfide bonds. When these residues are mutated to cysteine (P165C and Q170C), the resulting covalent linkage adds rigidity to the protein structure, leading to an increased melting temperature and enhanced stability by effectively reducing the local unfolding rate (jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Residue C67 has also been implicated in thermostability. Interestingly, the mutation from C67 to glycine (C67G) was found to increase thermostability by alleviating potential steric or binding constraints imposed by the native disulfide bond at this position, highlighting its complex role in both substrate binding and structural rigidity (parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14).

Although the specific study on T. ammonificans CA does not list all the surface residues directly, analogous studies on related carbonic anhydrases indicate that strategic mutations to enhance salt-bridge networks can significantly alter thermostability. In particular, mutagenesis studies on mesophilic carbonic anhydrases using mutations such as S44R, S139E, and K168R have demonstrated that the introduction of new salt bridges increases rigidity, reduces the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and consequently elevates melting temperatures. Their role as charged residues in forming a stabilizing network supports a similar mechanism in naturally thermostable enzymes like T. ammonificans CA (bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19).

In summary, in T. ammonificans CA the residues Cys47 and Cys202 are fundamental for structural stability through disulfide bonds, while alterations at N140, T175, A242, P165, Q170, and C67 modulate thermostability by affecting local flexibility, disulfide bridge formation, and overall network rigidity, with supportive evidence coming from multiple computational and experimental studies (fiore2015thermostablecarbonicanhydrases pages 6-9, parracruz2020engineeringofthermovibrio pages 10-14, jo2016engineeringdenovo pages 4-5, bharatiy2016insilicodesigning pages 19-19)."
Carbonic anhydrase ( T. ammonificans ),4C3T,A,H97,Coordinates the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion for CO₂ hydration.,"fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6",literature,,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,"The T. ammonificans α‐carbonic anhydrase structure (PDB 4C3T chain A) relies on a set of key residues for its catalytic and biochemical function. Several studies focusing on thermophilic bacterial α‐CAs consistently show that the enzyme’s activity depends on proper zinc ion coordination, proton transfer, and structural stabilization.

First, the zinc‐binding site is the heart of the catalytic machinery. In the LOGACA enzyme discussed by Fredslund et al., three histidine residues—His117, His119, and His136—coordinate the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion. Their side‐chain imidazole groups form bonds with the zinc ion at distances between 2.06 and 2.28 Å. This precise coordination positions the zinc to polarize a water molecule, thereby generating a zinc‐bound hydroxide that serves as the nucleophile attacking CO₂ during catalysis (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6).

Equally important is the mechanism for proton transfer. In the same study, His92 is identified as the proton shuttle residue. By moving between distinct conformations, His92 facilitates the removal of a proton from the zinc‐bound water molecule, thus regenerating the active site and ensuring continuous catalytic turnover. This role of a proton shuttle is a conserved feature in α‐CAs, also evidenced in other structurally characterized bacterial CAs (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 6-9).

Additionally, Thr202 is described as an important residue due to its proximity to the zinc site. Even though Thr202 in this enzyme does not directly coordinate the zinc‐bound water in the same manner as the corresponding residue in human CA II, its location near the catalytic center is critical for maintaining the proper active site configuration. Such subtle differences illustrate how bacterial enzymes may tune catalytic efficiency and adapt their local environments, a conclusion supported by both crystallographic data and structure–function comparisons across different α‐CAs (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 8-9).

Beyond the residues directly involved in catalysis, structural integrity is vital for enzyme function—especially under thermophilic conditions. The tetrameric arrangement of T. ammonificans CA is stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. In studies of the tetrameric enzyme form, key cysteine residues such as Cys47 (and others implicated in disulfide formation) contribute significantly to thermostability. These disulfide bonds maintain the structural framework required for proper active site orientation and are critical for the enzyme’s ability to function at elevated temperatures (james2014thestructureof pages 7-8, manyumwa2020alphacarbonicanhydrasesfrom pages 27-29).

In summary, the essential residues in T. ammonificans CA (PDB 4C3T chain A) can be grouped as follows:

• Zinc‐binding residues: His117, His119, and His136 coordinate the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion, forming the foundation for CO₂ hydration through generation of a reactive zinc‐bound hydroxide (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 4-6).

• Proton shuttle residue: His92 works to remove protons from the active site after water deprotonation, thereby sustaining catalytic turnover (fredslund2018structureofa pages 10-14, modakh2015structuralbasisfor pages 6-9).
